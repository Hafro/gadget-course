	Abstract = {For a linear regression model, the necessary and sufficient condition for the asymptotic consistency of the least squares estimator is known. An analogous condition for the nonlinear model is considered in this paper. The condition is proved to be necessary for the existence of any weakly consistent estimator, including the least squares estimator. It is also sufficient for the strong consistency of the nonlinear least squares estimator if the parameter space is finite. For an arbitrary compact parameter space, its sufficiency for strong consistency is proved under additional conditions in a sense weaker than previously assumed. The proof involves a novel use of the strong law of large numbers in C(S). Asymptotic normality is also established.},

	Abstract = {The authors consider a weighted version of the classical likelihood that applies when the need is felt to diminish the role of some of the data in order to trade bias for precision. They propose an axiomatic derivation of the weighted likelihood, for which they show that aspects of classical theory continue to obtain. They suggest a data-based method of selecting the weights and show that it leads to the James-Stein estimator in various contexts. They also provide applications. /// Les auteurs consid{\`e}rent une version pond{\'e}r{\'e}e de la vraisemblance classique qui s'impose lorsqu'il appara{\^\i}t opportun d'amenuiser l'influence de certaines observations dans le but d'atteindre un {\'e}quilibre entre biais et pr{\'e}cision. Ils d{\'e}crivent une axiomatique qui conduit {\`a} la vraisemblance pond{\'e}r{\'e}e, pour laquelle ils montrent que certains pans de la th{\'e}orie classique continuent de s'appliquer. Ils sugg{\`e}rent une m{\'e}thode adaptative de s{\'e}lection des poids et montrent qu'elle m{\`e}ne {\`a} l'estimateur de James-Stein dans diff{\'e}rents contextes.

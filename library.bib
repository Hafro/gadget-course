abstract = {Coastal and marine spatial planning (CMSP) is a key component of the US National Ocean Policy. Efforts to implement CMSP in US federal waters are beginning in earnest. Beyond sound science and data, a stakeholder engagement process that encourages public participation, collaboration and communication between disparate groups is at the heart of effective marine spatial planning (MSP). While a rich body of literature on stakeholder engagement exists, few opportunities exist to compare different stakeholder engagement processes as they occur on the ground for a particular stakeholder group. Between 2008 and 2010 marine spatial planning efforts were conducted by the neighboring US states of Rhode Island and Massachusetts. The Massachusetts Ocean Management Plan and Rhode Island Ocean SAMP provide models for the nation in structuring effective stakeholder processes for ocean management. Within both states, commercial fishermen were identified as key stakeholders.For this study, commercial fishermen's perceptions of the engagement process in Massachusetts and Rhode Island were examined. Specifically, this paper explores the role fishermen sought in these two pioneering MSP efforts, and the role they felt they actually played. Key findings include the need for clear communication of the role of stakeholders, stakeholder empowerment and background stakeholder analysis to understand the needs and challenges faced by participating groups. This work provided a unique opportunity to examine how each ocean planning effort engaged commercial fishermen and to reflect on lessons learned for future such initiatives in the US and beyond. Exploring effectiveness through the perceptions of primary stakeholders such as commercial fishermen further elucidates the challenges and opportunities of carrying out MSP and stakeholder processes in practice. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Standard search theory as well as some empirical evidence suggest that an unemployed individual's probability of entering employment increases as he approaches the time when unemployment benefits are due to expire. This pattern may not carry over to a country like Sweden, where labor market programs are targeted at the long-term unemployed at risk of benefit exhaustion. The paper examines transitions out of unemployment using data on unemployed individuals in Sweden. A semi-parametric competing risks model for transitions to employment, labor market programs and non-participation is estimated. There is some evidence that the exit rate from unemployment to employment increases as benefit exhaustion is approached.},

abstract = {Training by firms is a central means by which workers accumulate human capital, yet firms may be reluctant to provide general training if workers can quit and use their gained skills else-where. " Training contracts " that impose a penalty for premature quitting can help alleviate this inefficiency. Using two exogenously staggered contract changes at a leading trucking firm, we show that training contracts significantly reduce post-training quitting and increase the profitability of training. We demonstrate further that training contracts have especially large effects on training profits in our setting because of their interaction with worker overconfidence. If workers are over-confident about their own productivity at the current firm relative to their outside option, they will be more likely to sign training contracts and less likely to quit after training. Combining weekly productivity data with weekly productivity beliefs, we show that workers systematically overpredict their productivity, both with and without randomized financial incentives for accu-rate prediction. To quantify the impact of overconfidence for optimal contracts and welfare, we develop and estimate a structural learning model with biased beliefs that accounts for many key features of the data. Eliminating worker overconfidence would moderately increase worker welfare by 1.7{\%}, but would decrease training profits by over {\$}8,000 per truck and substantially alter the optimal training contract. We confirm the feasibility of reducing overconfidence using an informa-tion experiment at a second large trucking firm. Despite the positive effect of training contracts on profits, training may not be profitable unless workers are overconfident. Tadelis for their advice and encouragement. We especially thank the many trucking industry managers and drivers who shared their insights with us.

abstract = {Individual fishery quotas (IFQs) are an increasingly prevalent form of fishery management around the world, with more than 170 species currently managed with IFQs. Yet, because of the difficulties in matching quota holdings with catches, many argue that IFQs are not appropriate for multispecies fisheries. Using on-the-ground-experience with multispecies IFQ fisheries in Iceland, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada, we assess the design and use of catch-quota balancing mechanisms. Our methodology includes a mix of interviews with fishery managers, industry representatives, and brokers, literature review, and data analysis. We find that a combination of incentives and limits on use rates for the mechanisms provide sufficient flexibility to the quota owner without the fishery manager incurring excessive levels of overexploitation risk. Contrary to some opinions, these programs are evidence that it is possible to implement IFQ programs for multispecies fisheries and that they can be profitable and sustainable.},

abstract = {Since 1996, the demersal fisheries for cod, haddock, and saithe in Faroese waters have been regulated by a combination of fishing licenses, effort quota (days fishing), and area closures. The number of days initially allocated aimed at exerting an average annual fishing mortality rate of 0.45 on each of the three species. Considering that these stocks are taken in mixed fisheries, it had been hypothesized that effort would be targeted at the most available species, resulting in lower fishing mortality on the less available species, allowing them to recover. We review ten years of experience with the management system with special focus on the under-lying assumptions. Although the system appears to have achieved an appropriate balance in catch opportunities among the different fleet components and has minimized interference among gears, the objective of controlling fishing mortality on cod and saithe below the stated objective has not been achieved, partly because the original number of days allocated to fishing was too high. Also, there is no evidence that fleets switch target species according to relative abundance of all three species, which was one of the underlying assumptions of the effort management system. In view of the impact of major changes in productivity on stock development and exploitation, the current system cannot be expected to ensure spawning-stock biomasses above safe biological limits without a large reduction in the number of days allocated.},

abstract = {Quantifying fish stocks through modeling involves estimating time-varying parameters such as growth, stock recruitment, mortality rates and fishing levels. Each of these parameters vary non-uniformly and non-smoothly with time. For a given parameter, e.g., growth, the standard approach has been to estimate a single value of the parameter per time-step. When the modeling spans several time-steps this compounds the complexity of the model by increasing the dimension of the parameter space. This paper presents a method for reducing model complexity by effective reparameterization of selected time-varying parameters. The method involves representing the parameters by truncated (i.e., a finite) Fourier series, where the dimension of the Fourier coefficients is very much less than the number of time-steps in the modeling. Example results are presented, which show that the reparameterization can lead to over 40{\%} decrease in the number of model parameters associated with fishing levels, growth and stock recruitment. We illustrate using time-varying parameters associated with fishing levels, growth and stock recruitment, derived from an optimized biological model. The input data for the biological model is based on landed catch-data of Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus morhua). {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

However, this policy was often unsuccessful. In the last two to three decades, fisheries science and management have undergone a shift towards balancing sustainable yield with conservation, with the goal of including ecosystem considerations in decision-making frameworks. Scientific understanding of low-frequency climate-ocean variability, which is manifested as ecosystem regime shifts and states, has led to attempts to incorporate these shifts and states into fisheries assessment and management. To date, operationalizing these attempts to provide tactical advice has met with limited success. We review efforts to incorporate regime shifts and states into the assessment and management of fisheries resources, propose directions for future investigation and outline a potential framework to include regime shifts and changes in ecosystem states into fisheries management.},

However, in terms of per capita-based value, Okinoerabujima has the highest vulnerability with CVI of 0.910. We also found that these islands have relatively high income per capita, which may convey the impression of their strong economy (high resilience).

Under these conditions Markov Perfect (Nash) equilibrium game strategies are calculated and compared to the jointly optimal exploitation pattern. Not surprisingly, it turns out that the solution to the competitive game is hugely inefficient, leading very quickly to the virtual exhaustion of the resource. The scope for cooperative agreements involving the calculation of Shapley values is investigated.

A sample of 90 brackish water shrimp farms were surveyed in the region of Shyamnagar Upazila of the Satkhira District, Bangladesh, to study their economic efficiencies. Data were collected, using a questionnaire survey from September to October 2011. The mean technical efficiency level of the shrimp farmers was estimated at 82{\%}, and thus, farmers operate 18{\%} below the production frontier. The results suggest that the inefficiency effect is significant, and that education, age, non-farm income and distance of the farm are significant determinants of technical inefficiency. By operating at full technical efficiency levels, shrimp production can increase from the current yield of 225.56 to 265.28 kg/ha. Besides improving technical efficiency, technological progress and extension services (such as dissemination of proper information of the technological practices and further adoption of technological practices) can also contribute to increased shrimp production levels. Finally, quality feed and fingerling at affordable prices need to be ensured to further promote shrimp production.},

The purpose is to clarify how the different methodologies can contribute to management. It is hoped, this leaves the field of MCDM more tangible, visible and attractive to managers. It will be emphasized that an MCDM analysis can be carried out in many different ways and for different purposes, and that the outcome depends on the assumptions made.},

Yet the contested social impacts of restricted access, market-based resource management programs are increasingly documented in academic literature and continue to be a focus of social resistance and mobilization among those who have been displaced, or rationalized out of fishing in this process. The outcomes of ownership consolidation, loss of jobs and income, decreased labor mobility, prohibitive entry costs, loss of fishing rights from small communities and other distributional inequities can be understood broadly as the sociocultural effects of fisheries access restrictions this volume addresses. Drawing on rich ethnographic research in coastal communities in Alaska, British Columbia, Iceland, and New Zealand, this diverse collection of papers demonstrates the wide reach of privatization discourses and policies as experienced by people and communities dependent on fishing for livelihood and identity.},

abstract = {The ability to transform historical learning into institutional reform is a key to success in the management of common pool natural resources. Based on a model of institutional inertia and a comparative analysis of Northeast Atlantic fisheries management from 1945 to the present, the paper aims to identify drivers and obstacles to learning-based institutional reform. We argue that the ineffectiveness of implementation systems has been a key driver of reform requirements, but that the need for agreement amongst a large number of interdependent decision makers has been an obstacle to required reform. In such situations, distribution systems, especially, tend to become important obstacles to reform. Institutional inertia tends to be reinforced by tacit discourse frames: however, strong tensions between institutional inertia and needs for reform may also create room for innovation. Institutional inertia entails that large-scale management reform tends to be crisis driven.},

Is the solution more and better science or more and better politics? Does one need to improve the former, the latter or both? Or is something else missing? This paper investigates these questions by drawing on social theory and theories of knowledge. The issue of science versus politics and the role of different knowledge perspectives from stakeholders in decision-making are discussed with reference to the Regional Advisory Councils within EU fisheries, in particular, the council for the Baltic Sea. It is argued that a lost ‘value-rationality' and the aspects of phronetic knowledge and research need to be included in the highly instrumental and science-based EU fisheries policy system to establish environmental and social sustainability in the sector.},

@article{Yandle2008,
abstract = {Market-based approaches to environmental regulation (such as tradable permits or transferable quotas) are frequently offered as innovative solutions to many environmental problems. Globally, one of the most well-established forms of this approach is individual transferable quotas (or ITQs) in fisheries management. Within the natural resource management community, there is considerable debate over the effects ITQs have on the fishing industry and fisher behavior although this approach is not well-established in the United States. The previously imposed moratorium on ITQs in the United States has expired and the 2006 reauthorization of the Magnuson-Stevens Act explicitly provides for limited access privileges (LAPs). A variety of fishers, regulators, and conservation organizations are enthusiastically seeking to introduce ITQ management. With debate over whether and how ITQs should be used in American fisheries reinvigorated, it is timely to examine the evidence on the social and economic effects of ITQs in other nations' fisheries. After briefly summarizing the debate on ITQs, we examine the case of New Zealand, one of the earliest and longest-lived ITQ-based fisheries regimes. We use multiple data sources and methods to analyze the extent to which industry consolidation and aggregation has occurred, including surveys of industry participants, expert interviews, reviews of academic reports and analyses, analysis of trade publications, and direct analysis of quota ownership patterns. This analysis shows a more complex outcome than recent debates in the ITQ literature would predict. These findings suggest that policy makers considering ITQs can learn from the experiences of other countries related to key issues such as quota allocation, aggregation limits, transferability, cost recovery, and resource sustainability when designing ITQ and other LAP systems. It is also important to explicitly identify economic and social objectives and then carefully design ITQ regimes to meet these objectives.},

abstract = {The literature on game theory and fisheries is reviewed, beginning with the initial papers from the late 1970s on cooperative and noncooperative games. Later developments considered repeated games and trigger strategies as well as the stability of coalitions. It is argued that the latter literature is overly pessimistic in that it does not pursue breakdown of successive coalitions to its ultimate end, which may provide a worse outcome than an apparently unstable coalition. The choice of strategic variable is considered at some length, but in the existing literature this choice is seldom explicitly motivated. Similarly, the spatial distribution of fish is seldom analyzed in the existing literature, but it could make a difference. This article looks at fishing in a common pool, fishing in separate pools with interacting substocks, and sequential fishing. Fishing on the high seas is discussed and the enforcement issue identified as an underresearched problem. Imperfect information on fish stocks and their migrations is also underresearched.},

Our analysis yields two principal findings. We show that the coefficient on a group indicator variable from an OLS regression is an attractive approach for obtaining a single measure of the unexplained gap. We also show that a commonly-used pooling decomposition systematically overstates the contribution of observable characteristics to mean outcome differences when compared to OLS regression, therefore understating unexplained differences.

abstract = {Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries prob-lem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appro-priately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, econom-ics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring pow-erful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.},

Going thoroughly within policies and literature, it can be admitted that competitiveness is still vague, ambiguous, but wrapped up in ingenuity. There are still many open questions related to the definition of competitiveness, competitiveness factors, the applicability and the practical approaches to foster competitiveness.

At the time of its adoption, the Convention embodied in one instrument traditional rules for the uses of the oceans and at the same time introduced new legal concepts and regimes and addressed new concerns. The Convention also provided the framework for further development of specific areas of the law of the sea. The Convention entered into force in accordance with its article 308 on 16 November 1994, 12 months after the date of deposit of the sixtieth instrument of ratification or accession. Today, it is the globally recognized regime dealing with all matters relating to the law of the sea. The Convention (full text) comprises 320 articles and nine annexes, governing all aspects of ocean space, such as delimitation, environmental control, marine scientific research, economic and commercial activities, transfer of technology and the settlement of disputes relating to ocean matters.},

abstract = {Given the importance of consumer awareness of functional food ingredients for healthy food choices, the aim of this study is to explore consumers' ingredient awareness and the determinants which influence the awareness about functional food ingredients. A sample of 200 German consumers was interviewed via CATI (computer aided telephone interview) during September 2011. The participants have been asked about their specific awareness regarding to ten functional food ingredients. Likewise, determinants like health status and health motivation have been assessed and their influence on the construct “consumers' ingredient awareness” has been tested by employing structural equation modeling. The study shows that consumers' ingredient awareness varies throughout the sample. Overall it can be stated, that 19{\%} of consumer awareness about functional food ingredients is explained through the described model based on the following predictors: age, educational level, health status, health motivation and information strategies. Among these factors, consumers' health motivation seems to have the highest relevance to explain consumer awareness. But also the determinants information strategies as well as the education show a significant influence on consumers' ingredient awareness. As health motivation shows the highest impact on consumers' ingredient awareness this study underlines the importance of prevention propensity for healthy food choices.},

abstract = {This paper considers the problems of efficient management of common property ocean fishiries. The paper forwards the proposition that Pigovian taxes do not constitute a feasible method for fisheries management due to their huge data requirements. It appears, on the other hand, that the fundamental production externalities in ocean fisheries may in many cases be eliminated by instituting an appropriately designed system of property rights. A particular management method based on individual property rights in the fishery and discussed in the paper is not only capable of restoring economic efficiency in valuable ocean fisheries, it is also extremely informationally efficient in the sense that very little centralized collection of information is required for its operation. A further important advantage of this particular method is that it generalizes in a straightforward manner to multispecies fisheries. It appears, moreover, that this approach may also be applied to other cases of inefficient use of common natural resources.},

abstract = {Iceland's nationwide privatized Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system is over thirty years old but remains a topic of public and political debate, particularly because of the continued effects on small-scale fisheries. A national survey of small-boat fishermen was distributed to: (1) identify major defining characteristics of participants in ITQ and non-ITQ fisheries, (2) document and examine differences in satisfaction with fisheries management, and (3) evaluate the existing options for newcomers to participate in small-boat fisheries. Survey results indicate that Icelandic small-boat fishermen are engaged in multiple management systems within a wide range of boat sizes. Those who held quota were more satisfied with the current ITQ system compared to those who did not hold quota; however, nearly all fishermen were still critical of fisheries management in Iceland and the two major non-ITQ options of lumpfish and coastal fishing were not perceived to offer significant opportunity for entry-level fishermen. Dissatisfaction stemmed from the lack of decision-making power, a distrust of scientific advice, and the perception that the ITQ system did not serve the purpose of protecting fisheries resources, but was rather oriented only toward economic goals. The dynamic nature of Icelandic small-boat fishing livelihoods and the pervasive negative attitudes thirty years after ITQ implementation demonstrate the need for culturally appropriate and equitable fisheries management schemes where success is measured in social as well as economic and biological terms.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-based fisheries management (EBFM) approaches allow a broader and more extensive consideration of objectives than is typically possible with conventional single-species approaches. Ecosystem linkages may include trophic interactions and climate change effects on productivity for the relevant species within the system. Presently, models are evolving to include a comprehensive set of fishery and ecosystem information to address these broader management considerations. The increased scope of EBFM approaches is accompanied with a greater number of plausible models to describe the systems. This can lead to harvest recommendations and biological reference points that differ considerably among models. Model selection for projections (and specific catch recommendations) often occurs through a process that tends to adopt familiar, often simpler, models without considering those that incorporate more complex ecosystem information. Multi-model inference provides a framework that resolves this dilemma by providing a means of including information from alternative, often divergent models to inform biological reference points and possible catch consequences. We apply an example of this approach to data for three species of groundfish in the Bering Sea: walleye pollock, Pacific cod, and arrowtooth flounder using three models: 1) an age-structured “conventional” single-species model, 2) an age-structured single-species model with temperature-specific weight at age, and 3) a temperature-specific multi-species stock assessment model. The latter two approaches also include consideration of alternative future climate scenarios, adding another dimension to evaluate model projection uncertainty. We show how Bayesian model-averaging methods can be used to incorporate such trophic and climate information to broaden single-species stock assessments by using an EBFM approach that may better characterize uncertainty.},

Many commentators and policy makers refer to a “crisis” in fisheries, with a number of commercial species in serious decline and the livelihoods of fishers, especially those in smaller fishing communities, seriously threatened. This paper suggests that while much is known about the ecological and economic aspects of fisheries, the social and cultural impacts of fisheries and their management has been under-researched and is often overlooked in policy. The paper is composed of three sections: firstly, a review of European fisheries policy is presented, highlighting the lack of social objectives; secondly, a review of recent social science literature that addresses social and cultural aspects of fisheries management. Finally, as a result of this review, a number of gaps in the research agenda are identified and potential areas for future work are suggested in order to inform and influence the development of a sustainable fisheries policy. Such work is especially relevant and timely given the current review of the European Common Fisheries Policy, due to be completed by 1st January 2013.},

It identifies consumer trust as a distinct volition factor influencing the likelihood that consumers will act on green intentions and strongly emphasizes the needs to manage consumer trust as a prerequisite for the development of a market for green products. Specifically, based on a mixture of qualitative and quantitative methods, it is found that lack of consumer trust is a barrier for the development of a market for organic food in Thailand. Two focus groups and ten in-depth interviews revealed low knowledge about and low trust in organic food, certification, control, and labeling. Further, a mall-intercept survey (N = 177) revealed that lack of (especially) system trust reduces consumer expectations about benefits of buying organic food, and it makes them less likely to buy organic food. Mistrust in the control system and in the authenticity of food sold as organic has a significant negative impact on self-reported buying behavior. Implications for policy and future research are discussed.},

It is shown how catches and harvest policies change with the price of herring. Feedback policies are found for the optimally managed fishery. The management of the North Sea herring, after the moratorium was lifted in 1981, is evaluated. The results indicate that the management has been suboptimal. Under optimal management, the fishery should have stayed closed until 1983. We also find that the current stock is significantly larger than what maximises netfisheries revenues.},

Respondents expressed medium high to high levels of concern with sustainability issues at the general level, but lower levels of concern in the context of concrete food product choices. Understanding of the concept of sustainability was limited, but understanding of four selected labels (Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance, Carbon Footprint, and Animal Welfare) was better, as some of them seem to be self-explanatory. The results indicated a low level of use, no matter whether use was measured as self-reported use of different types of information available on food labels or as use inferred from the results of a choice-based conjoint analysis. Hierarchical regression indicated that use is related to both motivation and understanding, and that both motivation, understanding and use are affected by demographic characteristics, human values as measured by the Schwartz value domains, and country differences. The results imply that sustainability labels currently do not play a major role in consumers' food choices, and future use of these labels will depend on the extent to which consumers' general concern about sustainability can be turned into actual behaviour.},

abstract = {The coastal ecosystems of the Philippines are among the most heavily fished areas in the world. High dependency on fishery resources by an expanding population have resulted in overexploited and deteriorated fish stocks, perpetuating widespread poverty in fishing communities. Reducing fishing pressure through livelihood support provision for fishers could potentially alleviate poverty and mitigate deteriorating fisheries at the same time. However, this requires understanding fishers' behavior toward exiting the fishery and how different socioeconomic factors affect this behavior. We determined fishers' willingness to exit the fishery for different catch and monetary incentive scenarios in 6 coastal towns in the South China Sea biogeographic region of the Philippines. Half the fishers surveyed would continue fishing even when catches fall to 0.5kg a day. This translates to less than US{\$}1 gross income which is only about 15{\%} of the daily fishers' household expenses in the studied towns. For monetary incentives, 18{\%} of fishers were already willing to exit the fishery at US{\$}111 monthly incentives. This proportion increased to 51{\%} when the offer was increased to US{\$}222 which is about the same as the fishers' monthly household expenses. When the offer was increased to US{\$}333, 18{\%} of fishers still said they would prefer to continue fishing. Fishers who were newer to the fishery and exerting less fishing effort showed more willingness to exit the fishery for both catch and monetary incentive scenarios. Age and educational attainment also influenced fishers' exit decision. These findings demonstrate high heterogeneity in fishers' behavior toward exiting the fishery and that properly targeting those who are more willing to exit the fishery in livelihood programs might both effectively reduce fishing pressure and give fish stocks and other marine ecosystems a chance to recover while improving the fishers' well-being.},

We apply a discrete-time game-theoretic model in which we show that the EU should be allocated more than half of the TAC even if the EU has higher harvesting costs. This result is due to the distribution pattern of the herring, with a larger share of herring located in the EU zone. However, we find that according to the Nash bargaining solution, the current sharing allocates too large a share to the EU. Document Type: Article {\$}\backslash{\$}n},

First, they define that component to be fluctuations lasting no fewer than 6 and no more than 32 quarters; this is the definition of business-cycle frequencies used by Baxter and King. Second, they define the business-cycle component on the basis of a decomposition of the series into permanent and transitory components. The conclusions are the same in both cases. The filters perform adequately when the spectrum of the original series has a peak at business-cycle frequencies. When the spectrum is dominated by low frequencies, the filters provide a distorted business cycle. These findings suggest that the use of the HP and BK filters with series having the typical Granger shape is highly problematic. /// Les auteurs {\'{e}}valuent l'efficacit{\'{e}} avec laquelle le filtre de Hodrick-Prescott et le filtre passe-bande propos{\'{e}} par Baxter et King permettent d'isoler la composante cyclique des s{\'{e}}ries macro{\'{e}}conomiques.

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Individual Transferable Quotas stand in large parts of the fisheries economic literature as the panacea that solves all problems of overfishing and overcapacity of world´s fisheries. However, they are also criticized by a number of authors based on their negative social effects. Individual Transferable Quotas have been increasingly used during the past decades and are the main management system in a number of countries today. This paper provides evidence of the economic, social and environmental effects of one such system ten years after its introduction in Danish fisheries starting in 2003 with herring and being fully implemented from 2007. It is found that together with an important reduction in the fleet size, economic profitability improved. The direct con-tribution to GDP from the fleet in terms of economic return increased and indirectly through the capital and labour released from the fisheries sector, which have been absorbed by other sectors. Full-time employment has been reduced by 68{\%} with fishermen salary largely unchanged, which might have affected the social cohesion in the local fishing communities negatively. However, no significant difference in the evolution of unemployment in local fishing communities compared to the national average was found. The Danish experience proves that Individual Transferable Quotas can be an adequate solution with regards to overfishing and overcapacity with also positive effects on the environment due to reduced fuel consumption and fishing activity. The social effects are ambiguous seeing that fisheries employment decreases; however, unemployment rates in the affected communities are below the national average.},

Despite severe depletion of cod and other species, governance insiders prevent consideration of regulatory alternatives.

abstract = {A variety of tools are available to quantify uncertainty in age-structured fish stock assessments and in management forecasts. These tools are based on particular choices for the underlying population dynamics model, the aspects of the assessment con- sidered uncertain, and the approach for assessing uncertainty (Bayes, frequentist or likelihood). The current state of the art is advancing rapidly as a consequence of the availability of increased computational power, but there remains little consistency in the choices made for assessments and forecasts. This can be explained by several fac- tors including the specifics of the species under consideration, the purpose for which the analysis is conducted and the institutional framework within which the methods are developed and used, including the availability and customary usage of software tools. Little testing of either the methods or their assumptions has yet been done. Thus, it is not possible to argue either that the methods perform well or perform poorly or that any particular conditioning choices are more appropriate in general terms than others. Despite much recent progress, fisheries science has yet to identify a means for identify- ing appropriate conditioning choices such that the probability distributions which are calculated for management purposes do adequately represent the probabilities of even- tual real outcomes. Therefore, we conclude that increased focus should be placed on testing and carefully examining the choices made when conducting these analyses, and that more attention must be given to examining the sensitivity to alternative assumptions and model structures. Provision of advice concerning uncertainty in stock assessments should include consideration of such sensitivities, and should use model-averaging methods, decision tables or management procedure simulations in cases where advice is strongly sensitive to model assumptions.},

Several EU fish stocks-particularly North Sea cod-had reached dangerously low levels, and there was widespread dissatisfaction with the way in which the CFP was operating. The European Commission took the opportunity of the legal requirement to review some features of the CFP (principally access provisions) in 2002, to undertake a broader reappraisal of the CFP. One of the features of this reappraisal was an attempt to improve the CFP's system of governance by increasing the amount of stakeholder participation, decentralisation, transparency, accountability, effectiveness and coherence. In this paper, the conclusion is reached that this attempt to improve the quality of governance in the 2002 CFP reform package has been more rhetorical than real. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Current efforts at assessing the vulnerability of fishing communities center around the creation of quantitative indices. The quantification of social data, however, has several drawbacks. These include the loss of detail, removal of historical context, and obscuring of power dynamics. The Means, Meanings, and Contexts (MMC) Framework is presented as an alternative methodology, one that allows for the integration of qualitative social science into the understanding of community vulnerability, drawing upon ethnographic research techniques and theories of place-making. Place-making refers to the changing relationships between the physical support offered by a landscape (means), and the relationships among place, people, and lifestyle in a community (meanings). To adequately assess community vulnerability, researchers can collect data on both means and meanings within a community. Using these data, community vulnerability is assessed by responding to a series of 12 broad prompts. Responses to these prompts are summarized at three levels of detail: detailed textual description, tabular summary, and graphical summary. Using the Pribilof Island communities of St. George and St. Paul, Alaska as examples, this framework indicates that St. George is a highly vulnerable community, while St. Paul is moderately vulnerable. These results are in stark contrast with quantitative assessments of community vulnerability, which indicate that St. George is a low to moderately vulnerable community, while St. Paul is a highly vulnerable community. Tools like the MMC Framework, therefore, help make a place for important, but complex, qualitative social data, in fisheries management.},

It examines the structures, market and non-market values, and challenges of these programs. The primary aim of the research, based on interviews involving 20 programs and a conference workshop, was to advance understanding of the market value of alternative seafood marketing to fishers and communities. However, the importance of a broader set of non-market values was repeatedly highlighted by those engaged in these programs. Overall, the research suggests that alternative seafood marketing can enable fishers to participate in fisheries managed by neoliberal, market-based policies, through the promotion of market values along their diverse value chains. At the same time, alternative seafood marketing appears to resist market-based fishing systems, sometimes through the promotion of broader, non-market outcomes. Common challenges along these alternative seafood value chains highlight the structural conflicts that exist while simultaneously participating in and resisting neoliberal fisheries structures.},

@article{Marchal2014,
abstract = {ABSTRACT SUMMARY The Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reforms agreed by European Union (EU) ministers include a discard ban where fishers will be required to land all fish they catch. The ban is expected to reduce the risk of capturing unwanted and low-value biomass species, and therefore should make fishing more environmentally and economically sustainable. The implications of introducing a discards ban may be gauged by assessing the practical and economic issues surrounding whether discards not destined for human consumption can be used once landed. Interviews with company managers established the attitude of the main commercial outlets towards suitability of, and interest in using discards. Results indicate that opportunities for using discards include reduction to fishmeal and fish oil, ensiling, composting, anaerobic digestion with energy recovery, and freezing (prior to use as bait). In the UK, nine main outlets expressed interest in using discards as raw materials to process into animal, pet and aqua feed; organic fertilizer; frozen bait; and other products, such as renewable energy generation. Estimates of discard quantities from English fleets show that most of the outlets are not located close to the main landing ports where the discards would likely come ashore. However, most outlets have extensive established transport links, which would enable them to cover even the remote ports. Preliminary analysis on cost of discarding shows that a discard ban will lead to increases in annual operating costs for fishers ranging from GB{\pounds}1709–90 959 yr−1 ({\pounds}1 = US{\$} 1.52, May 2013). Assuming that discards are processed for fishmeal, fetching c. GB{\pounds}130 t−1, then majority of the fishers will make losses in their fishing operations. Such losses could lead fishers to adopt more selective gears in order to avoid catching unwanted species and thereby help conserve the marine environment. Finding potential uses for discards is important in the context of the proposed land-all catch policy under the reformed CFP, but the primary goal of government should be to prevent the capture of unwanted fish.},

abstract = {Climate changes in the 21st century are ex- pected to significantly increase ocean temperatures and mod- ify other oceanographic conditions in the North Atlantic. Marine biological research suggests that the impacts on the commercially most important fish stocks in the Icelandic- Greenland ecosystem may well be quite substantial. This will obviously lead to a corresponding impact on the economies of these two countries. However, the timing, extent and biolog- ical impact of global warming is quite uncertain. As a result the economic impact is similarly uncertain. This paper attempts to provide estimates of the impact of altered fish stocks due to global warming on the Icelandic and Greenland economies. The approach is one of stochastic simulations. This involves essentially three steps. The first is to obtain predictions of the impact of global warming on fish stocks and the associated probability distribution. For this we rely on recent marine biological predictions. The second step is to estimate the role of the fisheries sector in the two economies. This is done with the help of modern econometric techniques based on economic growth theory and historical data. Obviously these estimates are also subject to stochastic errors and uncertainty. The third step is to carry out Monte Carlo simulations on the basis of the above model and the associated uncertainties. The result of the Monte Carlo simulations consists of a set of dynamic paths for GDP over time with an expected value and a probability distribution for each future year. On this basis it is possible to calculate confidence intervals for the most likely path of GDP over time. The results indicate that the fisheries impact of global warming on the Icelandic GDP is more likely to be positive than negative but unlikely to be of significant magnitude com- pared to historical economic growth rates and fluctuations. The uncertainty of this prediction, however, is large. For Greenland, the impact on fish stocks and the GDP is highly likely to be positive and quite substantial relative to the cur- rent GDP. Due to less knowledge of the relationship between the fisheries sector and the Greenland economy, however, the confidence interval of this prediction is even wider than in the case of Iceland.},

However, forward projections and their associated estimates of uncertainty are an important and popular piece of management advice. We describe a less computationally intense method to estimate uncertainty in forward projections that includes both parameter uncertainty and future demographic stochastic uncertainty. This frequentist method uses penalized likelihood as an approximation to mixed effects and can be viewed as treating the future projection period as part of the estimation model rather than performing stochastic projections. This allows confidence intervals to be calculated using normal approximation based on the delta method. The method is tested using simulation analysis and compared with Bayesian analysis and with projections based on point estimates of the parameters. The method is applied to yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean. {\textcopyright} 2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Harvest control rules (HCRs) have been implemented for many fisheries worldwide. However, in most instances, those HCRs are not based on the explicit feedbacks between stock properties and economic considerations. This paper develops a bio-economic model that evaluates the HCR adopted in 2004 by the Joint Norwegian-Russian Fishery Commission to manage the world's largest cod stock, Northeast Arctic cod (NEA). The model considered here is biologically and economically detailed, and is the first to compare the performance of the stock's current HCR with that of alternative HCRs derived with optimality criteria. In particular, HCRs are optimized for economic objectives including fleet profits, economic welfare, and total yield and the emerging properties are analyzed. The performance of these optimal HCRs was compared with the currently used HCR. This paper show that the current HCR does in fact comes very close to maximizing profits. Furthermore, the results reveal that the HCR that maximizes profits is the most precautionary one among the considered HCRs. Finally, the HCR that maximizes yield leads to un-precautionary low levels of biomass. In these ways, the implementation of the HCR for NEA cod can be viewed as a success story that may provide valuable lessons for other fisheries.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: We conducted a comparative ecosystem analysis to understand environmental and biological drivers of production dynamics of 2 common species groups, cod (Gadus morhua and G. macrocephalus) and herring (Clupea harengus and C. pallasii), across 13 large marine ecosystems. For all 4 species, we fit a hierarchy of nested surplus production models with terms for trophodynamic and biophysical covariates; models were then compared using an information-theoretic framework. Across ecosystems, models including terms for biophysical covariates exhibited stronger fits to the data and were often included in the top set of selected models. However, the numerical effects of covariates differed among systems and species. For example, surplus production in several ecosystems was significantly affected by sea surface temperature, but to differing degrees (i.e. direction and magnitude of effect). Similarly, surplus production of cod was positively associated with herring biomass in 4 of the ecosystems examined, whereas negative trophodynamic interactions alluded to complex cultivation-depensation food-web dynamics in 5 other systems. Importantly, no single covariate emerged as the most important predictor of surplus production nor were biological reference points from models with covariates always more conservative than those without covariates. This suggests that inclusion of trophodynamic and biophysical covariates in simple production models has the potential to increase model fit, but the relative benefit will be stronger for systems and species where trophodynamic and biophysical processes are tightly coupled to species productivity.},

@article{Hannesson2013,
abstract = {In his comment, Professor Knut Heen states the following: " In his effort to prove and demonstrate that transferable quotas and licenses will improve the profitability of the industry, his use of both indicators and data warrants a comment. Using data from the Directorate of Fisheries in Norway makes it difficult to support Hannesson's conclusion that the transferability of quota and licenses improves the profitability of the fishing vessels. " Much of the analysis in my paper is based on return before tax, excluding financial costs, in percent of invested capital. In my view, this is the most appropriate time series available to gauging the profitability of the industry. Unfortunately this time series is too short to cover the period before the rules of quota trading were liberalized, due to changes in definitions in the accounts published by the Norwegian Directorate of Fisheries. I have therefore resorted to also showing return before tax in percent of revenue. Alternatively, I could have used operating margin in percent of revenue, which is what Professor Heen recommends, but the results are qualitatively similar, the main difference is that using the operating margin would shift the curve upwards (see Fig. 1). There is a clear break for the better in both of these time series in the mid-1990s. Professor Heen points out that the steep increase 1994–97 was in part due to an upward jump in the price of mackerel. Other positive developments, such as increasing catches of blue whiting in these years, also played a role. But the increase in profits has been maintained; profits averaged –3{\%} of revenues 1980–94, but 11{\%} 1995–2010 (using the operating margin would change these numbers to 7{\%} versus 17{\%}). This increase would not have been maintained unless access to the industry had been restricted, and I note that Professor Heen seems to endorse closed access. Furthermore, the structural rationalization of the purse seine fleet was resumed in 1996, after having stalled in the late 1980s and early 1990s; the number of small purse seiners (less than 6000 hectoliters) fell from 29 in 1995 to 11 in 2010 while the number of large purse seiners has remained much the same (it fell from 74 in 1995 to 69 in 2010). It is likely, to say the least, that this rationalization has been promoted by the more liberal rules for trading in fish quotas introduced in 1996. I do not think that the cost per unit of effort, which Professor Heen reports in some detail, tells us much of interest about the effects of quota trade and fleet rationalization. He defines effort as vessel days and shows that the cost per vessel day has increased considerably. Professor Heen makes no correction for inflation, but that is unlikely to change his results qualitatively. The reason why the cost per vessel day has increased is probably that the boats are now on average larger than they used to be and use more fuel and perhaps other fishing gear. But they also catch more fish, so the rising cost is more than outweighed by larger revenues. From 1994 to 2010 the operating costs of the purse seiners rose threefold, but their revenues rose almost fourfold (by a factor of 3.7 to be exact). Fleet rationalization could easily mean a higher cost per boat, but it also means larger and more productive boats. Professor Heen points out that in order to correctly calculate the return on capital invested in boats, one should only correct for financial costs associated with investing in boats. True enough in principle, but financial costs are reported only in the aggregate in the accounts at hand. If these data were available, the said correction would shift the return on boats slightly downwards, but we would still have the difference in return on total capital and on boats only. The point I wanted to illustrate is that the return on total capital looks more normal than the return on boats only. In the long run, the return on total capital in the fishing industry should be the same as in other industries, after correcting for differences in risk. In the quota managed industry a part of the total invested capital is the value of purchased fish quotas while the open access industry invests in boats only and aligns the return on investment with other industries through excessive costs. Professor Heen does not appear to be against transferable quotas as such, but he objects to the way quotas have been given away for free so that quota holders have been able to enrich Contents lists available at ScienceDirect},

abstract = {abstract. Fishery activities in Greece have a strong impact on the structure of the ecosystems and the patterns of sustainability of fish resources. The presented information model consists of a multi-dimensional database on sea fishery in Greece and data mining software for sustainability analysis of fish resources. The 2241 time series data for the period 1990–2007 are stored in database and concerns quantity of fish catch by areas, species, months, kind of fishery and fishing tools as well as value and employment. The developed system of data mining rules applies the computing of de-scriptive statistics and trend models. The database analysis shows sustainability for total fish catch in the time period 2000–2007, but some significant changes of the fish catch by areas and by species. The attained information has 2 aspects: (1) ecological, regarding needed measures to control water quality and minimise pollutions of coastal areas; (2) economical, related to effective management of sea fish resources in Greece. An analysis of the mined information, for the present and the future, can support experts and researchers in the fields of biology and ecology to study changes in sea fish communities, in biodiversity and in marine ecosystems as a whole. A key characteristic of most sustainable development analysis and policy is the attempt to provide framework in terms of which ecological, social and economic dimensions are integrated 1 . Each dimension is dynamic, complex and evolving in its own right 2 . Greece supports marine fishery in order to enhance domestic sea food con-sumption and export to other countries as well. On the other hand, fisheries activities have a strong impact on the structure of the fishery ecosystems and the patterns of sustainability of fish resources.

The empirical results confirm that the entry, stay, and exit decisions are significantly associated with the earning potential of fishers, crowding externality, resource abundance and some managerial factors. The probability of a vessel to stay (or exit) in the fishery increased (or decreased) for an increase in the earning potential of a fisher. A larger fleet size shows vessels were more inclined to exit from the fishery than stay in the fishery. The probability of vessel entry (or exit) was also positively (or negatively) associated with an increase in stock levels of major target species. Further, a vessel was more likely to stay in the fishery when the vessel owner was a Hawaii resident or a vessel captain. Simulation of the probability for a vessel to enter, stay, or exit for a change in fleet size or stock level was also carried out.},

We also find evidence of economically rational behavior through the relationship between quota lease and sale prices and fishing output and input prices, ecological variability, and market interest rates. Controlling for these factors, our results show a greater increase in quota prices for fish stocks that faced significant reductions, consistent with increased profitability due to rationalization. Overall, this suggests that these markets are operating reasonably well, implying that ITQs can be effective instruments for efficient fisheries management. {\textcopyright}2004 Elsevier Inc.

The inhabitants of the village have not been able to take advantage of the new system in which fewer and larger companies are taking over. The inhabitants are consequently faced with the process of increased marginalization that presents new challenges to which men and women respond differently. The coping mechanisms adopted by women stress community and working together whereas men respond more on an individual level.

abstract = {The introduction of property rights to manage common pool resources is often met by opposition from some incumbent users, despite evidence of large increases in resource rents. We introduce an analytical model with cost heterogeneity to distinguish between rents to high skill and traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners. We show that despite large aggregate gains from property rights, some current users may prefer common pool management, demonstrating the importance of initial allocations of rights. In our empirical application, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource. * For helpful comments and suggestions, we thank Robert Deacon, Gary Libecap, Trevor O'Grady, Quinn Weninger, and various seminar and conference participants.

We suggest that part of the knowledge generated by academic economists is case-based rather than rule-based. That is, instead of o¤ering general rules or theories that should be contrasted with data, economists often analyze models that are “theoretical cases”, which help understand economic problems by drawing analogies between the model and the problem. According to this view, economic models, empirical data, experimental results and other sources of knowledge are all on equal footing, that is, they all provide cases to which a given problem can be compared. We of- fer complexity arguments that explain why case-based reasoning may sometimes be the method of choice and why economists prefer simple cases.},

I find that the return to schooling among identical twins is about 10{\%} per year of schooling completed. Most importantly, unlike the results reported in Ashenfelter and Krueger, I find that the within-twin regression estimate of the effect of schooling on the log wage is smaller than the cross-sectional estimate, implying a small upward bias in the cross-sectional estimate. Ashenfelter {\&} Krueger's measurement error corrected estimates are insignificantly different from those presented here, however.

The economic benefits derived from fish stocks involve the amount of revenue generated from fish processing, which is linked to both the way fish are harvested and the products produced from the fish. In this study we econometrically estimate a flexible revenue function for catcher-processor vessels operating in the Alaskan pollock fishery, recognizing potential endogeneity and a variety of fishing inputs and conditions. We find significant own-price supply responses and product substitutability, and enhanced revenues from increased fishing days and tow duration after a regulatory change introduced property rights through a newfishing cooperative.We also find significant growth in economic productivity, or higher revenues over time after controlling for observed productive factors and price changes, which exceeds that attributable to increased harvest. These patterns suggest that the move to rights-based management has contributed significantly to economic performance in the pollock fishery.},

As a result, the inferences drawn from such studies with respect to the functional forms and the nature of technical progress have not been duly convincing because of the aggregation and related problems. In the present study, we utilize a panel of thirty-two halibut fishing boats representing data that cover seven years of the boats' fishing operations. Halibut fishing in the North Pacific is regulated by the International Pacific Halibut Commission, and the regulations are provided for by a convention between the United States and Canada. The regulatory measures, which are based on biological studies, aim at providing a maximum sustainable yield of halibut to the enterprises comprising the fishery. To analyze the economic effects of such regulations, Crutchfield and Zellner (1963) conducted two surveys during 1957 and 1959, one on the operations and incomes of the Seattle halibut fleet and another on the incomes of the halibut fishermen. In the boat survey, a sample of fifty boats was taken and information on revenues, operating expenses, and physical characteristics of the boats collected. These data, representing information for the years 1953 through 1957, were used for an analysis of rates of return on invested capital and of earnings of boat captains and fishermen (see Crutchfield and Zellner, 1963, pp. 82-94). However, an analysis of the underlying production processes was not performed. We have recently made a similar survey of thirty-two Seattle halibut boats for the years 1958 through 1964. In this second survey, we collected information on more variables than did the first survey.[1] For each boat for most of the years under analysis, we have collected, from income tax records contained in the files of the Fishing Vessel Owners' Association and from the official files of the International Pacific Halibut C...

This systematic review synthesizes the results of the published research from 31 studies on the effects of secondary school size from OECD countries since 1990. Overall the directions and patterns of effect vary for different outcomes. For pupil attainment measured by exam results, and for attendance, larger schools appear to do better up to some optimal school size but estimates of this point or range are insufficiently precise to be useful. The implications of different school sizes on student behaviours are equivocal, but teachers and pupils at smaller schools are more likely to have a positive perception of their ‘school environment'. Costs per pupil appear to decrease as school size increases. The results of the review suggest that there is little empirical evidence to justify policies that aim to ‘change' or mandate particular school sizes. However, given the evidence that there do appear to be optimal sizes for some outcomes, stakeholders should be made aware that dramatic changes in a school's size may change the characteristics of a school's learning environment.},

abstract = {This paper provides a brief description of the origin, evolution, structure and performance of the ITQ (individual transferable quota) system in the Icelandic fisheries. The current ITQ fisheries management system in Iceland was instituted gradually over a period of 15 years. An IQ (individual quota) system was initially imposed in the herring fishery in 1975 and transformed into a fully fledged ITQ system in 1979. An IQ system was introduced in the capelin fishery in 1980 and turned into an ITQ system 1986. An ITQ system was introduced in the demersal fisheries in 1984. Since 1990 all fisheries within the Icelandic EEZ (exclusive economic zone) have been subject to a uniform system of individual transferable quotas with only minor exceptions. The system, however, is still evolving and consequently subject to further modification and change. The paper discusses the social and economic impetus for the initial adoption of the ITQ fisheries management system in the various fisheries, sketches its subsequent development and describes the main features of the current system. It presents assessments of the biological and economic impact of the ITQ system and discusses its future prospects. The paper finds clear evidence of positive biological and economic impacts of the ITQ system in the herring and capelin fisheries. In the demersal fisheries, the evidence is more mixed, although also in these fisheries there is evidence of substantial economic benefits stemming from the ITQ system{\$}\backslash{\$}n},

Our primary focus is on the primal formulations. Several competing specifications such as production function, input (output) distance function, input requirement function are considered. We show that all these specifications come from the same transfor- mation function and are algebraically identical. We also show that:(i) unless the transformation function is separable (i.e., outputs are separable from inputs), the input (output) ratios in the input (output) distance function can not be treated as exogenous (uncorrelated with technical inefficiency) resulting in- consistent estimates of the input (output) distance function parameters. (ii) Even if input (output) ratios are exogenous, estimation of the input (output) distance function will result in inconsistent parameter es- timates if outputs (inputs) are endogenous. (iii) In the translog model with production uncertainty, input (output) ratios are not exogenous even if outputs (inputs) are exogenous which will make the distance function parameters inconsistent. We address endogeneity and instrumental variable issues in details in the context of both restricted (Cobb-Douglas and Constant-Elasticity of Transformation) and flexible (translog) functional forms.

In this paper, we estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for alternative public school campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2007-2011, and provide evidence as to the relative cost efficiency of alternative education charter schools.},

Based upon both previous projects on the subject and a recent project which attempted to construct cost-effectiveness comparisons from the What Works Clearinghouse of the Institute of Educational Sciences of the U.S. Department of Education, we have identified a set of recommendations for practice that should have high priority if we are to construct valid cost-effectiveness comparisons for policy uses when choosing among alternative educational interventions.},

abstract = {This article presents the results of a detailed study of potential cost savings from consolidation of New York school districts. It extends past research on consolidation by developing a theoretical framework which distinguishes several dimensions of economics of scale and defines an empirical cost function for schooling. The results indicate potentially sizeable costs savings from consolidation of districts with fewer than 500 pupils. Using such districts as candidates for consolidation, the study examines in detail the implications of merging these districts with one of their neighbors and finds relatively few districts strong candidates for full consolidation in New York, although some may benefit from sharing of administrative and support functions. The estimated cost model also sheds light on potential diseconomies associated with large city school districts. While findings apply directly to New York, the method developed here has general relevance to state education policy by helping to target candidate school districts for consolidation, and, where consolidation is not feasible, adjusting state aid formulae to reflect more accurately the cost impacts of scale.},

The second problem is that it is not invariant to units of measurement. In this paper we propose a multi-stage DEA methodology which involves a sequence of radial LPs. We observe that this new approach will identify more representative efficient points and that it is also invariant to units of measurement. The methodology is illustrated using a simple example.},

Catch shares are hypothesized to halt the race by securing each individual's right to a portion of the total catch, but there is evidence for this from selected examples only 2,9 . Here we systematically analyse natural experiments to test whether catch shares reduce racing in 39 US fisheries. We compare each fishery treated with catch shares to an individually matched control before and after the policy change. We estimate an average policy treatment effect in a pooled model and in a meta-analysis that combines separate estimates for each treatment–control pair. Consistent with the theory that market-based management ends the race to fish, we find strong evidence that catch shares extend fishing seasons. This evidence informs the current debate over expanding the use of market-based regulation to other fisheries. In fisheries, the competitive race to fish compresses fishing seasons, with detrimental ecological and economic effects and increased occu-pational risks},

Such challenges are currently felt on the Faroes, where fish and fish related products account for 94 percent of total exports. Hence, ideas on how to make the fisheries sustainable are thriving. By drawing attention to the diverse ways that Faroese have organised socio-ecological relations of fishing, and the different meanings or modes of knowing and perceiving the environment (rationalities) that socio-ecological relations of fishing have drawn upon, this thesis problematises the understanding of fish-stock depletion as a problem that can be solved through techno-scientific policies and institutional reform. By engaging in a critical analysis of narratives on sustainable fisheries and the environmental history of fishing on the Faroes, this thesis argues that fish-stock depletion is a material manifestation of a structural problem in the world-system, with onto-epistemological roots in the Cartesian paradigm of modernity of which neoclassical economics is a discursive expression. 3 Acknowledgements},

The community aspect is crucial in this respect. How do they perceive their own function and embeddedness in the community?

Skippers and vessel owners are modelled as if risk-neutral. Skippers develop a fishing strategy which is more costly, the higher the value of the potential catch associated with that strategy. Costs that accrue are partly pecuniary (and shareable) and partly skipper-specific (and non-shareable).

The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) provides an effective framework for such an analysis. The AHP is generally used to evaluate importance amongst criteria based on the concept of paired comparison. This paper considers the development of a representative criteria hierarchy, and uses data obtained from a pairwise comparison survey based on the UK fisheries of the English Channel to investigate priorities that exist among different interest groups in the fisheries.

abstract = {Fuzzy cognitive mapping was used to develop a participatory ecosystem management plan for Uluabat Lake, Turkey. Interviews were conducted with stakeholders belonging to six different groups. Lake pollution was the most central and most mentioned variable for stakeholders. Stakeholder groups agree that lake pollution is negatively affecting ecosystem health and thereby local economies. Thus, reducing lake pollution was chosen as the overall goal for the management plan. Possible ways to reduce lake pollution and increase ecosystem health were seen differently by the different groups. Hunters, factory managers, NGO personnel, and local people thought industry was the main cause of lake pollution, while officials from the government and local municipalities thought roads and urban development contributed the most to lake pollution. Generally the stakeholder groups did not perceive their own actions as affecting the lake as strongly as other groups thought. For example, factory managers viewed factory pollution as negatively affecting the lake but less strongly than the other groups did. According to policy option simulations, reducing lake pollution had positive effects on all variables, especially fish, birds, animal husbandry, irrigation, agriculture, and the ecological balance of the lake. Results of this analysis were used to facilitate meetings among stakeholder groups and to develop a participatory ecosystem management plan. The analysis was useful for pointing out the similarities as well as the differences among the groups. It also helped the facilitators understand the focus of each stakeholder group and enabled them to suggest activities in which each group would want to participate.},

With a focus on the Asia-Pacific region, it summarizes the projected biological and socio-economic effects of increased emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) for coastal fisheries and illustrates how all the important dimensions of climate change and ocean acidification can be integrated into the steps involved in the EAFM planning process. The activities required to harness the full potential of an EAFM as an adaptation to climate change and ocean acidification are also described, including: provision of the necessary expertise to inform all stakeholders about the risks to fish habitats, fish stocks and catches due to climate change; promotion of trans-disciplinary collaboration; facilitating the participation of all key stakeholders; monitoring the wider fisheries system for climate impacts; and enhancing resources and capacity to implement an EAFM. By channeling some of the resources available to the Asia-Pacific region to adapt to climate change into an EAFM, developing countries will not only build resilience to the ecological and fisheries effects of climate change, they will also help address the habitat degradation and overfishing presently reducing the productivity of coastal fisheries.},

abstract = {In industries characterized by frequent innovation and high productivity growth, substantial variation in produced quantity and input use may occur, leading to increased costs. An effect that has received little attention is that inefficiency can exacerbate environmental impacts. This effect is particularly important if environmentally damaging inputs are overused. In addition to increasing firms' costs, such inefficiency can also increase the environmental impact of the firm's activity. This makes the degree of inefficiency in an industry an issue for environmental regulators. In this paper, we estimate technical and allocative efficiency for a sample of Norwegian salmon farmers. Our results show that both technical and allocative inefficiency on average are significant in explaining the level and variation in farm costs, and that the main environmental impact due to inefficiency from the Norwegian salmon aquaculture industry has its origin in technical inefficiency. ?? 2009 Elsevier Inc.

Many current high-profile disputes arise from conflicting objectives, and the proposed solutions to “the fisheries problem” are primarily particular stakeholders' efforts to have managers implement their own objectives. I suggest many “failures” are in fact successes for other objectives. Fisheries objectives, as reflected in management actions, are changing. Two current trends are the acceptance of objectives that value less disturbed ecosystems and acceptance of fisheries allocation through dedicated access to improve the fisheries' economic efficiency.

The two ITQ fishery management systems studied were implemented in 1990 and are still in the early stages of development: Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog ITQs in the US Extended Economic Zone, and Under 65' Mobile Gear Groundfish ITQs in the Scotia-Fundy region of Atlantic Canada. We note differences and similarities in the two fisheries and factors that precipitated the decision to switch to ITQs, the process itself, the design of the two ITQ systems and some of the consequences. Among the lessons learned from the comparative study are the critical importance of decisions about transferability of quotas and the political and historical context, and pre-existing industry structure, to the acceptance and performance of ITQs. In addition, the research shows mixed results for questions about relationships between exclusive property rights and stewardship, on the one hand, and between individual quota systems and co-management on the other. We consider these and other findings in the light of evaluative criteria such as economic efficiency, social equity and stewardship.},

abstract = {Because food fraud can harm human health and erode consumer trust, it is imperative that it is detected at an early stage. Therefore the aim of this study was to predict the expected food fraud type for imported products for which the product category and country of origin are known in order to target enforcement activities. For this purpose we used a Bayesian Network (BN) model that was developed based on adulteration/fraud notifications as reported in the Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) in the period 2000–2013. In this period 749 food fraud notifications were reported and were categorised in 6 different fraud types (i) improper, fraudulent, missing or absent health certificates, (ii) illegal importation, (iii) tampering, (iv) improper, expired, fraudulent or missing common entry documents or import declarations, (v) expiration date, (vi) mislabelling. The data were then used to develop a BN model. The constructed BN model was validated using 88 food fraud notifications reported in RASFF in 2014. The proposed model predicted 80{\%} of food fraud types correctly when food fraud type, country and food category had been reported previously in RASFF. The model predicted 52{\%} of all 88 food fraud types correctly when the country of origin or the product-country combination had not been recorded before in the RASFF database. The presented model can aid the risk manager/controller in border inspection posts in deciding which fraud type to check when importing products.},

Under some circumstances, risk-averse workers actually prefer to be paid on the basis of rank. In addition, if workers are heterogeneous in ability, low-quality workers attempt to contaminate high-quality firms, resulting in adverse selection. However, if ability is known in advance, a competitive handicapping structure exists which allows all workers to compete efficiently in the same organization.},

We first estimate total factor productivity from a parsimonious specification of the aggregate production function involving output per worker, capital per worker, and the labor force, both with and without the stock of human capital. Then we test for absolute and conditional convergence of total factor productivity and real GDP per worker, using cross-section and cross-section, time-series data. Fixed-effect estimates across countries convert the cross-section test of absolute convergence into a pooled test of conditional convergence, since it controls for country-specific effects. Our tests consider both ??- and ??-convergence. Our findings support both absolute and conditional ??-convergence of total factor productivity, but only conditional convergence of real GDP per worker. Further, ??-convergence tests must measure absolute convergence, since conditional convergence assumes that an equilibrium dispersion of total factor productivity or real GDP per worker exists. We find mixed evidence for absolute ??-convergence. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science Inc. All rights reserved.},

In this paper we investigate the effects of various effort restrictions on the behaviour of fishermen outside of the ITQ system. Empirical estimates from duration model analysis are presented which measure the effects of various management measures aimed at affecting the behaviour of those “outsiders” as well as the indirect effect of the ITQ system on the behaviour of those who stayed outside of it. The results show that outsiders had incentives to stay outside of the ITQ system and free-ride on the behaviour of the ITQ fleet. Management measures aimed at restricting their effort proved to be ineffective. The conclusions can be generalized to other situations where property rights based management systems are used and economic agents harvest a common resource pool.},

I propose an approach to data weighting based on these principles.

Typically, resource rentals take the form of a payment by a commercial enterprise to the state. Resource rentals can be viewed as a tax on resource rents (i.e., on net income derived from the use of a resource) or as royalties or access fees to a resource. The Icelandic Fishery Management Act requires that vessel owners pay a resource rental in the form of the “catch fee” (veidigjald), which is one of the first attempts to explicitly use resource rent generated in fisheries as a base for government revenue. This paper first discusses the legislative activity leading up to the introduction of the catch fee, followed by a discussion of how the Fishery Management Act defines the fee. Then, the effect of using a quota-lease-charge rule is discussed and finally there is an evaluation of whether the catch fee is high enough.},

abstract = {Fisheries management is increasingly involving a wide range of stakeholders in the decision making process. However, in most fisheries, the set of management objectives are poorly defined, and the implicit importance placed on these objectives may vary considerably both between and within different stakeholder groups. This may lead to conflicts within management advisory groups where members from different stakeholder groups view potential management outcomes substantially differently, and inconsistencies in decision making when changes in stakeholder representation take place. In this paper, the institutional structure of fisheries management in Australia and the roles the different organisations play in shaping fisheries management plans are detailed. An explicit hierarchy of management objectives is developed in collaboration with key managers and policy makers. A large survey of stakeholders involved in Australian Commonwealth fisheries management was undertaken to determine stakeholder preferences relating to these objectives. The results highlight the differences in perspectives regarding the relative importance of the multiple objectives of fisheries management. While on average stakeholder preferences generally correspond with their expected preference set, the results also indicate that there is generally low coherence within stakeholder groups.

abstract = {Research on the sustainability of capture fisheries has focused more on environmental and economic sustainability than on social sustainability. To assess social sustainability, first relevant and important social sustainability issues need to be identified. The objective of this study was to identify relevant social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic and to determine the importance of these issues based on stakeholder input. A heterogeneous group of stakeholders was invited to take part in two consecutive surveys on social sustainability issues. The first survey (n = 41) resulted in a long list of 27 relevant social sustainability issues, including six issues that were not identified in previous studies and that address aspects of fish welfare, employees' training and education opportunities, and employees' time off from work. The second survey (n = 51) resulted in a ranking of the social sustainability issues in order of importance. The most important issues are worker safety, product freshness and companies' salary levels. In general, social sustainability issues concerning working conditions, employees' job fulfilment and fish welfare are seen as more important than other social sustainability issues. A main discussion point concerns the relation between the importance of a social sustainability issue on the one hand and the type of need that the issue relates to and the state of the issue on the other hand. From the study it can be concluded that the relative importance of social sustainability issues differs per stakeholder group depending on the relation between the stakeholder group and each particular issue. This demonstrates the importance of consulting different stakeholder groups in future studies on social sustainability in order to get a balanced view on the importance of social sustainability issues. Results on the relevance and importance of social sustainability issues for cod and haddock fisheries in the northeast Atlantic enable the fishing industry and policy-makers to direct improvement efforts towards the more important issues.},

abstract = {It is almost ten years since the FAO Technical Consultation on the Precautionary Approach to Capture Fisheries took place in Lysekil, Sweden. One outcome from this Technical Consultation was a set of guidelines on the precautionary approach to capture fisheries and species introductions. These guidelines include the need to incorporate harvest control rules in management plans. Harvest control rules should specify what action is to be taken when speci- fied deviations from the operational targets and constraints are observed. The specification should include minimum data requirements for the types of assessment methods to be used for decision-making. Combinations of harvest control rules, assessment methods and data collection schemes are referred to as management procedures. It is now well-recognized that using management procedures is likely to lead to improved conservation of fishery resources, and that they should be evaluated to assess whether they are likely to achieve the goals for fishery management given the types of uncertainties that are likely to frustrate this venture. In general, evaluation of management procedures has been based on simulation modeling. This paper reviews the progress that has been made in various fisheries jurisdictions in terms of implementing management procedures, and why and where it has proved difficult or even impossible to implement management procedures},

abstract = {The Icelandic fishing industry has had to deal with reduced total catch for the past three decades. It has adapted well to the reduction and the Icelandic ITQ system has made this easier. The industry has adapted by reducing employment, closing factories and scrapping boats. Specialization has as well increased and the focus is more toward high-value markets. The profitability of the Icelandic fishing industry has markedly increased. This is especially true for the processing aspect of the industry where profits have soared. One of the main reasons for this increase is the ITQ management system. The rise in profitability of the fishing component, however, is considerably less than that of the processing part. This is the result of higher oil prices and the introduction of the fishing fee, and its subsequent increase, which is now a considerable expense for the fishing component of the Icelandic fishing industry. The debt levels of the industry reached a peak in 2008 after a massive escalation which began in 2004 and was mainly caused by the Icelandic financial bubble, 2004-2008, although the ITQ system also played a role here. Since 2008 the financial health of the industry has improved enormously. Currently, the financial situation of the Icelandic fishing industry is, on the average, sound; this particularly applies to the largest and smallest firms.},

abstract = {After the Second World War the Norwegian government planned a large scale modernization of the entire fishing industry in northern Norway. The industrialization of the land-based processing industry and the construction of a totally new trawler fleet gained massive public financial support. The new technological adaptations were built around a vertically integrated corporate model. As a reference to the modernization concept, the seasonal coastal fisheries were defined as outdated and not able to meet the modern expectations of full-time employment and improved salaries. In this context, the trawler fleet was supposed to feed the processing industry with stable supplies of fresh fish and thus secure a fully vertically integrated production model. However, almost from the start, the model never functioned according to the political goals, i.e. an economically viable sector with secure and stable employment. Instead, the project was characterized by efficiency problems, internal disputes between the fleet and the processing factories, institutional inertia within the public sphere and finally a decoupling of the entire model. This article outlines how deep-sea trawling originally gained acceptance in the political landscape, how it developed over the years (1950-2013) and how the technological development finally was uncoupled from the needs of the processing industry. The article explains this development through the idea of technological changes as socially constructed and modified, emphasizing that successful technological transformations have to be in line with basic social values and perceptions. {\textcopyright}2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Expansion and development of the fisheries sector was the driving force behind Iceland's economic transformation during the 20th century. However, the role of fisheries in national and regional economies is neither well documented nor understood. National accounts do not fully reflect the significant part played by the fisheries as they do not take into consideration the various ways economic activity in the fisheries sector affects other branches of the economy. The fisheries sector, which includes fishing and fish processing, has been established as a base industry within the Icelandic economy. Using data collected during 2010 and 2011 and cluster analysis techniques, this paper seeks to establish the economic importance of the fishing industry in Iceland. As a base industry, this paper finds that a wide range of companies have gradually developed to service the sector and through these interlinkages, the fisheries sector and its related operations can be viewed as an industry cluster. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The main objective of the paper is to investigate to what extent different type of regulatory contracts affect company performance. The panel model proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995) allow for year/company specific efficiency measures to be estimated. Thus, unobservable network or other time invariant characteristic of the operating environment can be controlled for by analyzing the dynamics of measured productivity across time for firms regulated under different types of contracts, rather than relying solely on variations across com- panies during one time period. Therefore, the paper offers methodological and data advantages over previous work on this subject. The main and robust result of the paper is that the adoption of a more high-powered scheme based on a yardstick type of regulation significantly reduces operating costs. The results contained in this paper thus confirms theoretical predictions regarding the incentive properties of high powered incentive schemes and in particular the dynamic benefits of yardstick competition.},

abstract = {The historical expansion of fishing industries into the deep sea has been described at the global level, but corresponding patterns are less well known at other geographical scales. The International Council for the Exploration of the Sea (ICES) has stated that most deep-sea species exploited by European fishing industries are harvested outside safe biological limits. As a result, the European Union commenced regulating exploitation of deep-sea stocks with total allowable catches (TACs). These regulations have been operational since 2002, but no detailed overview of their effectiveness is hitherto available. The objectives of this paper are: 1) to analyse changes in mean depth of fishing of the EU fleet before (1950–1982) and after (1983–2006) the adoption of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP), 2) to analyse the degree to which the European Council follows scientific advice on sustainable catches provided by ICES and 3) to investigate the degree to which the fishing industry complies with agreed catch limits. Our results indicate that the EU fleet has experienced a bathymetric expansion by an average of 78 m depth for the 1950–2006 period, or almost twice the value (42 m) previously reported for the global fleet. This pattern of expansion towards deep-sea fishing grounds has not changed under the CFP. Additionally, the paper demonstrates that the mean longevity of species caught by the EU fleet increased with depth, from about 13 years for shallow water species to about 25 years for intermediate species and about 60 years for deep-sea species. Thus, fishing deeper means fishing for increasingly long-lived and vulnerable species. This study also shows that approved TACs for deep-sea fish stocks did not follow scientific advice. Scientifically proposed TAC levels were not respected in about 60{\%} of the cases investigated and these approved TACs were not complied. Member States exceeded agreed quotas in about 50{\%} of the cases during the 2002–2011 period. Reported catches were on average 3.5 times greater than approved for deep-sea species, but in some cases catches even 10–28 times higher than agreed. The identified pattern that Member States fail to respect approved quotas indicate a lack of incentives to comply, likely as a consequence of limited enforcement and sanctioning mechanisms. Ensuring long-term sustainability of deep-sea stocks is urgently needed but requires dramatic change to the existing management system.},

For the period 1990–2014, the analysis traces the development of relative quota holdings of the biggest actors operating large vessels as well as firms that employ smaller boats that are only allowed to use hook-and-line. A more detailed data set is used for the period 2001–2014 which allows for a more thorough investigation of consolidation in both fleet segments using Herfindahl-Hirchman Indexes, Gini coefficients and Lorenz-curves. The biggest firms in the two fleet segments increased their share of quotas throughout the period but the quota market is though still quite competitive. The distribution of quotas between firms has become more unequal, and there is also clear evidence of increasing transfers between harbours, especially in the case of the quota shares of hook-and-line boats. However, the results also indicate that spatial concentration has been much less than consolidation at firm level during the period under consideration. This would indicate that firms have mostly grown in size by merging with local firms or buying out smaller local operators.},

abstract = {Total allowable catch (TAC) management has in many fisheries, especially mixed fisheries, failed to meet conservation objectives. For instance, for the Faroe Plateau mixed demersal fisheries, the TAC system failed to achieve the objective of an average annual fishing mortality of 0.45 for the three gadoid stocks cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), and saithe (Pollachius virens). Therefore, in 1996, an effort-regulation system with individual transferable effort quotas was introduced to manage the fisheries. Experience has shown that effort management without additional stock-specific measures may not be appropriate for such fisheries. A management strategy evaluation model was developed to compare an effort-management system based on the Faroese example with a TAC system as currently applied in EU fisheries. Results show that when stocks are considered in isolation, a total allowable effort system does not necessarily perform better than a TAC one. It depends on stock status and dynamics, the level of uncertainty, and the reactivity of the system to changes in scientific advice. When the stocks are considered together in mixed fisheries, effort management seems, however, to be appropriate, and interannual flexibility of the system appears to be the best compromise between short-and long-term objectives, as well as between biological sustainability and economic return.},

MU status should only be assigned when the observed estimate of genetic divergence is significantly greater than a predefined threshold value. We emphasize the need for a demographic interpretation of estimates of genetic divergence given that it is often the dispersal rate of individuals that is the parameter of immediate interest to conservationists rather than the historical amount of gene flow. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Economic losses in marine fisheries resulting from poor management, inefficiencies, and overfishing add up to US{\$}50 billion per year. Taken over the last three decades, these losses total over US{\$}2 trillion, a figure roughly equivalent to the GDP of Italy.The Sunken Billions: The Economic Justification for Fisheries Reform argues that well-managed marine fisheries could turn most of these losses into sustainable economic benefits for millions of fishers and coastal communities.According to this book, the bulk of losses occur in two main ways. First, depleted fish stocks mean that there are fewer fish to catch, and therefore the cost of finding and catching them is greater than it might be. Second, fleet overcapacity means that the economic benefits of fishing are dissipated due to redundant investment and operating costs. The book stresses that the figure of US{\$}50 billion represents a conservative estimate, as it excludes losses to recreational fisheries and marine tourism as well as losses due to illegal fishing.The Sunken Billions argues that strengthened fishing rights can provide fishers and fishing communities with incentives to operate in an economically efficient and socially responsible manner. Phasing out subsidies that enhance redundant fishing capacity and harvesting effort will improve efficiency. Greater transparency in allocation of fish resources and greater public accountability for fisheries management and health of fish stocks will help eco-labeling initiatives to certify sustainable fisheries.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-Based Management (EBM) has gained international popularity in recent years, but the lack of consensus on its definition has precluded the use of a universal implementation framework. The large number and variety of principles that make up EBM, and the diversity in perspectives among key management players, has impeded the practical application of EBM. Agreement on a list of the essential ingredients of EBM is vital to successful application. A frequency analysis of EBM principles was conducted to identify the Key Principles that currently define EBM, from a list of twenty-six principles extracted from a subset of the EBM theoretical/conceptual literature (covering a range of published sources across disciplines and application types). Fifteen Key Principles were identified (in descending frequency of appearance in the literature): Consider Ecosystem Connections, Appropriate Spatial {\&} Temporal Scales, Adaptive Management, Use of Scientific Knowledge, Integrated Management, Stakeholder Involvement, Account for Dynamic Nature of Ecosystems, Ecological Integrity {\&} Biodiversity, Sustainability, Recognise Coupled Social-Ecological Systems, Decisions reflect Societal Choice, Distinct Boundaries, Interdisciplinarity, Appropriate Monitoring, and Acknowledge Uncertainty. This paper also examines the development of EBM principles over time, leading to predictions on the directions EBM will take in the future. The frequency analysis methodology used here can be replicated to update the Key Principles of EBM in the future. Indeed, further research on potential emerging Key Principles such as ‘Consider Cumulative Impacts', ‘Apply the Precautionary Approach' and ‘Explicitly Acknowledge Trade Offs' will help shape EBM and its successful application in the management of marine activities.},

abstract = {The collapse of the northern Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) fishery off southern Labrador and to the northern Grand Bank of Newfoundland, once the largest cod fishery in the world, was a social and economic disaster for the region. An analysis of traditional catch-at-age data in conjunction with research surveys, which assumed that research survey estimation errors of abundance by age and year were independent, led assessment biologists to the conclusion that the collapse was caused by an increase in natural mortality in the first half of 1991. We constructed a statistical model to test this hypothesis. The results do not support the hypothesis. There is ambiguous evidence that natural mortality has increased since 1991; however, these results are found only in a model that has extraordinary patterns in the residuals. Our analysis suggests that even if natural mortality has been higher in recent years (as estimated using a model with correlated errors for research surveys), overfishing was sufficiently high to cause a collapse of this population. We also demonstrate that the usual assumption that estimation errors from research trawl surveys are independent is not valid, and can lead to invalid inference and unreasonable estimates of abundance.},

abstract = {By comparing the real reductions in fishing capacity of the European Union (EU) and the effects of technological efficiency, this paper presents the first comprehensive analysis since the creation of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Using a standard methodology and a conservative value of ±4.4{\%} for annual technological progress, the results obtained for tonnage indicated that the EU-13 fleet's fishing capacity was reduced by {\textgreater}4{\%} for only three years (1991, 2004, and 2006) in the 1987–2006 period. This result shows that technological efficiency always grew faster than the real reduction of fishing capacity. Moreover, the reduction of the fishing power of the EU-13 fleet exceeded 4{\%} annually only in 1991 (5.2{\%}), 2004 (6.6{\%}), and 2006 (6.5{\%}). These results demonstrate a high level of incoherence and inefficiency of the CFP in terms of reducing fishing capacity over time. The results presented here highlight the fact that the overcapacity problem is the key issue that should be addressed by the next CFP-reform.},

Secondly, we trace the development and nature of changes in German LMP since the 1990s.

Thirdly, we review competing theoretical approaches that might explain this turn in LMP and conclude that changed interpretative patterns have been crucial to understand the overall shift.

abstract = {Abstract Modern aquaculture is a relatively new activity among Nepalese farmers and a small contributor to the economy. Given the abundance of water resources and fish species, rising demand for fish, and its high profitability, aquaculture has potential for future expansion if it is given appropriate attention from the government. In Nepal, productivity in aquaculture is much lower compared to other countries in the region, which suggests that there is potential for increased fish production through technological progress and improvement in farm?level technical efficiency. However, no formal analysis has yet been conducted to assess the productive performance of Nepalese aquaculture and its potential for future improvement. Against this background, this paper examines the technical efficiency and its determinants for a sample of fish pond farms from the Tarai region of the country using a stochastic production frontier involving a model for technical inefficiency effects. The estimated mean technical efficiency is 77{\%}, with intensive farms being more efficient than extensive farms. The adoption of regular fish, water, and feed management activities has a strong positive effect on technical efficiency.},

The study focusses on some of the selective gears and the additional fishing opportunities used to encourage their uptake that are available as part of the Scottish Conservation Credit Scheme, which was set up to support the EU cod (Gadus morhua) recovery plan. We first demonstrate that the classification of the gears in the scheme is appropriate in relation to how they select for cod. We then evaluate the short-term direct and indirect financial impacts related with the different gear options. The analysis is carried out in relation to five different fleet segments of the Scottish whitefish fleet which are identified on the basis of the vessel size, engine power and gear fished and shows that with appropriate incentives, it is possible to introduce more selective gears without reducing profitability. The degree to which this can be achieved, however, will vary by fleet segment and will depend on the incentives on offer, the catch composition of the economically important species and the selective performance of the modified gear over this range of species. We also demonstrate that what incentivises one segment may not encourage another.},

abstract = {Harvest policies use control rules and associated policy parameters to dictate how fishing mortality or catch and yield levels are determined, and are necessary for rational management. Common control rules include constant catch, constant fishing mortality rate, constant escapement, or a few variations of these. The "best" among these control rules for meeting common fishery objectives (e.g., maximizing yield) is a source of controversy in the literature, and results are seemingly contradictory. To compare the ability of control rules to meet widely used fishery objectives and identify potential causes for these apparently contradictory results, we did a detailed review of relevant literature. The relative performance of control rules at meeting common fishery objectives is affected by: whether uncertainty in estimated stock sizes is included in analyses, whether the maximum recruitment level (e.g., the asymptote of a Beverton-Holt stock-recruit function) is varied in an autocorrelated fashion over time, fishery objectives, and the amount of compensation in the stock-recruit relationship. Few studies have compared control rules using optimal parameters (e.g., those that maximize some objective function) that were found while including assessment error. More commonly, parameters that are optimal without assessment error are used in a comparison of control rules that includes assessment error. This approach can produce misleading results. Ideally, selection of a control rule and policy parameters is done within the framework of a stochastic simulation that considers key uncertainties. If this is not feasible, an alternative option is to "borrow" control rules from a similar fishery and set policy parameters based on biological reference points developed for a species with similar taxonomy and life-history traits. More research is needed to compare control rules when accounting for uncertainty in key population parameters, when stock-recruitment or other population dynamic parameters vary over time, and for fisheries with non-yield-based or competing objectives. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The international spring-spawning herring fishery, based on potentially one of the most valuable fish stocks in the world, is currently recovering from a severe depletion of the stock and subsequent harvesting moratorium. Management of the herring fishery is complicated by its multi-nation exploitation, due to the highly migratory behaviour of the species moving between several coastal state zones ( exclusive economic zones, EEZ's) and the high seas ( Ocean Loop). Based on extensive work invested on analysing both the biology of the herring stock and the fisheries economics around its exploitation we study here the profiles of different multi-agent management schemes, simulating catch levels, stock size and profit potentials of alternative management strategies. The stock dynamics are described by a linear discrete-time age-structured population model and the economics are presented by a rent maximising model with constant price of herring catch and different costs of harvesting and efficiency levels for the different national fleets. The simulations, carried out over several decades, show that the benefits of international co-operation far exceed the returns of a competitive open access fishery.},

How might the world income distribution look in the future? These questions have been the subject of much empirical and theoretical work over the last decade, beginning with Abramovitz (1986) and Baumol (1986), continuing with Barro (1991) and Mankiw, Romer and Weil (1992), and including most re-cently work by Quah (1993a, 1996). This paper provides one perspective on this literature by placing it explicitly in the context of what it has to say about the shape of the world income distribution. We begin in the first section by documenting several empirical facts concerning the distribution of GDP per worker across the countries of the world and how this distribution has changed since 1960.1 The main part of the paper attempts to characterize the future of the world income distribution using three different techniques. First, we use a standard growth model to project the current dynamics of the income distribution forward, assuming the policies in place in each country during the 1980s continue. One can interpret this exercise as forecasting the near-term income distribution. The results indicate that the near-term income distribution looks broadly like the current dis-tribution. However, there are some notable exceptions, primarily at the top of the income distribution, where a number of countries are predicted to continue to converge toward and even overtake the United States as the richest country in the world. Second, we exploit insights from the large literature on cross-country growth ' For a related review of the facts, see Parente and Prescott (1993) and Jones (forthcoming).

We ask whether changes in fleets affect resource dynamics and whether trends in resource influence fleet dynamics more than external drivers do. External drivers include vessel buyback, fuel price, and fish prices, as well as environmental fluctuations. Resource status is measured by abundance and length metrics; fleet capacity is measured by total horse power, and economic metrics such as profitability and earnings are examined as well. A maximum likelihood approach is used to identify the combined metric trends with the largest support in the data. The approach is applied to the French Bay of Biscay fisheries in 2000–2007. Combined-metric time trends suggest that decreases in fleet capacity did not result in decreasing fishing impacts; trends in stocks and fish prices were not the major drivers of changes in fleets either.

@article{Mankiw1989,
abstract = {T he debate over the source and propagation of economic fluctuations rages as fiercely today as it did 50 years ago in the aftermath of Keynes's The General Theory and in the midst of the Great Depression. Today, as then, there are two schools of thought. The classical school emphasizes the optimization of private economic actors, the adjustment of relative prices to equate supply and demand, and the efficiency of unfettered markets. The Keynesian school believes that understanding economic fluctuations requires not just studying the intricacies of general equilibrium, but also appreciating the possibility of market failure on a grand scale. Real business cycle theory is the latest incarnation of the classical view of economic fluctuations. It assumes that there are large random fluctuations in the rate of technological change. In response to these fluctuations, individuals rationally alter their levels of labor supply and consumption. The business cycle is, according to this theory, the natural and efficient response of the economy to changes in the available production technology. My goal in this essay is to appraise this newly revived approach to the business cycle. I should admit in advance that I am not an advocate. In my view, real business cycle theory does not provide an empirically plausible explanation of economic fluctuations. Both its reliance on large technological disturbances as the primary source of economic fluctuations and its reliance on the intertemporal substitution of leisure to explain changes in employment are fundamental weaknesses. Moreover, to the extent that it trivializes the social cost of observed fluctuations, real business cycle theory is potentially dangerous. The danger is that those who advise policy-makers might attempt to use it to evaluate the effects of alternative macroeconomic policies or to conclude that macroeconomic policies are unnecessary. The typical undergraduate course in microeconomics begins with partial equilib-rium analysis of individual markets. A market for a good is characterized by a downward sloping demand curve and an upward sloping supply curve. The price of the good is assumed to adjust until the quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded. The course then builds up to Walrasian general equilibrium. In this Walrasian equilibrium, prices adjust to equate supply and demand in every market simultane-ously. The general equilibrium system determines the quantities of all goods and services sold and their relative prices. The most important theoretical result, after the existence of such a Walrasian equilibrium, is the "invisible hand" theorem: the equilibrium is Pareto efficient. Courses in microeconomics thus show how employment, production, and relative prices are determined without any mention of the existence of money, the medium of exchange. The simplest way to append money to the model is to specify a money demand function and an exogenous money supply. Money demand depends on the level of output and the price level. The level of output is already determined in the Walrasian system. The price level, however, can adjust to equate supply and demand in the money market. Introducing money in this way leads to the classical dichotomy (Patinkin, 1956). Real variables, such as employment, output, and relative prices, including the real interest rate, are determined by the Walrasian system. Nominal variables, such as the price level, the nominal wage, and the nominal interest rate, are then determined by the equilibrium in the money market. Of course, since nominal variables do not affect real variables, the money market is not very important. This classical view of the economy suggests that, for most policy discussions, the money market can be ignored. The professor of macroeconomics must in some way deal with the classical dichotomy. Given the assumptions of Walrasian equilibrium, money is largely irrele-vant. The macroeconomist must either destroy this classical dichotomy or learn to live with it. Keynesian macroeconomics destroys the classical dichotomy by abandoning the assumption that wages and prices adjust instantly to clear markets. This approach is motivated by the observation that many nominal wages are fixed by long-term labor contracts and many product prices remain unchanged for long periods of time. Once the inflexibility of wages and prices is admitted into a macroeconomic model, the classical dichotomy and the irrelevance of money quickly disappear. Much of the early work in the new classical revolution of the 1970s attempted to destroy the classical dichotomy without abandoning the fundamental axiom of continuous market clearing (Lucas, 1972; 1973). These models were based on the assumption that individuals have imperfect information regarding prices. These individuals therefore confuse movements in the overall price level (which under the classical dichotomy should not matter) with movements in relative prices (which should matter). An unanticipated decrease in the money supply leads individuals to},

Design/methodology/approach A quantitative research methodology using survey data was used. Data were collected by administering questionnaires from millennial respondents (n = 386) from the USA and Turkey. Findings The results show that cultural value (collectivism) and materialism can serve as moderators of the effects of status motivation and sustainability. The findings indicate that the link between status motivation and sustainability perceptions (both environmental and social sustainability) is stronger for more collectivist consumers.

It covers topics left out of most microeconometrics textbooks and omitted from basic introductions to Stata. This revised edition has been updated to reflect the new features available in Stata 11 that are useful to microeconomists. Instead of using mfx and the user-written margeff commands, the authors employ the new margins command, emphasizing both marginal effects at the means and average marginal effects. They also replace the xi command with factor variables, which allow you to specify indicator variables and interaction effects. Along with several new examples, this edition presents the new gmm command for generalized method of moments and nonlinear instrumental-variables estimation. In addition, the chapter on maximum likelihood estimation incorporates enhancements made to ml in Stata 11. Throughout the book, the authors use simulation methods to illustrate features of the estimators and tests described and provide an in-depth Stata example for each topic discussed. They also show how to use Stata'"s programming features to implement methods for which Stata does not have a specific command. The unique combination of topics, intuitive introductions to methods, and detailed illustrations of Stata examples make this book an invaluable, hands-on addition to the library of anyone who uses microeconometric methods.},

A survey focused on the current EU regulatory framework was carried out to elicit stakeholders' preferences, knowledge and experience on key issues for the development of organic aquaculture, supported by science-based regulations. The survey was completed by 65 stakeholders belonging to several categories, and it was supported by the implementation of the Analytic Hierarchy Process method. Stakeholders' preferences were elicited on organic production methods and control systems, the quality of the environment and organic products, fish health and welfare. The views expressed by the participants revealed both competence and awareness, despite the complexity of the subject. Several ideas and useful suggestions emerged regarding unresolved technical issues. In addition, the need for a targeted communication strategy on the quality of organic aquaculture products and the necessity of fostering European/national programs to support the production and marketing of organic aquaculture products were highlighted.},

We find three such common factors, each of which is associated with a set of factor loadings that indicate the extent to which each state's economy is related to the national business cycle. According to the factor loadings, there is a great deal of heterogeneity in the nature of the links between state and national economies. In addition to exhibiting geographic patterns, the closeness of state economies to the national business cycle is related not only to differences in industry mix but also to non-industry variables such as agglomeration and neighbor effects. Finally, we find that the common factors tend to explain large proportions of the total variability in state-level business cycles, although, again, there is a great deal of cross-state heterogeneity.},

In addition, we provide a number of detailed empirical applications using real-world data. The book can be used as a textbook or as a reference text.

abstract = {There are numerous government and industry actions that could advance consumer choices for healthier and environmentally sustainable food products. This study investigates the effect of point-of-purchase actions; price changes, health and/or environment logos, health and/or environment product information labels. Three hypothetical choice experiments investigated choices between specific products and their healthy and sustainable alternatives: rice (white versus brown rice, n=280), meat (beef versus kangaroo steak, n=344) and tomatoes (tinned versus fresh tomatoes for a tomato sauce, n=320). Data was collected via an online survey from a representative nationwide sample of Australian household grocery buyers (N=944). Results show that the effects of the investigated actions are very product and consumer segment dependent. In general, price changes, particularly a decreased price (subsidy) for the healthy and sustainable alternatives, had a bigger effect on shifting choices than did a logo and/or label. Product similarity seems to play an important role as we observed the greatest shift in choices in the rice experiment with more respondents opting for brown rice instead of white rice. The responsiveness of consumers to the investigated measures was largely influenced by whether they were familiar with, and liked, the healthy and sustainable product alternative. In conclusion this study indicates that point-of-purchase actions may partially contribute to advance uptake of healthy and sustainable food alternatives. The effects of such measures are expected to be greater when these alternatives are more similar to the standard products for their sensory properties, convenience, product liking and familiarity.},

Key concepts were that most of the available funding would support industry participation, that industry, not scientists, would come up with the ideas for projects, and that commercial fishing vessels and fishing methods would be used to address specific concerns of the fishing industry in a scientifically controlled manner. Nearly 100 projects had been commissioned by March 2012, covering annual time-series surveys of stocks subject to traditional assessment, and ad hoc projects on, e.g. gear selectivity, discard survival, tagging and migration and fishery development. The extent to which the results of the projects have been used by stakeholders, fishery scientists and fishery managers at a national and E.U. level is evaluated, along with the degree of industry interest and involvement, and reasons are identified for successes or failures in the uptake of the results into management and policy. Finally, the question is posed whether the programme has been successful in improving the engagement of the fishing community in the science-management process and in fostering communication and greater trust between fishers, scientists and managers.},

abstract = {Multivariate analyses constitute an integral part of today's marine integrated ecosystem assessments (IEAs). Principal component analysis (PCA) is one of the most common of these techniques, and the method has been used repeatedly to summarize the dynamics of marine ecosystems. There seems to be little recognition of the potential pitfalls associated with performing PCA on time-series that are autocorrelated and/or non-stationary. We investigate how the descriptive performance of PCAs may be affected by the structure of the underlying time-series and question whether such analyses can provide useful summaries of ecosystem trajectories. For this purpose, we reanalyse four datasets from the Barents, Norwegian, Baltic, and North Seas. We compare the results with those obtained from simulated datasets that share similar trend and autocorrelation properties, but in which the variables are unrelated. We show that most of the patterns revealed by the PCA can emerge from random time-series and that the fraction of the variance that cannot be accounted for by random processes is minimal. The Norwegian Sea dataset is a pathological case in which the variance explained by the first two components only exceeds what would be expected from randomly simulated time-series by 2{\%}. We conclude that outputs from explorative multivariate analyses provide very little insight into ecosystem status, trajectories and functioning. IEA groups need to be equipped with methods that can provide better insight into how marine ecosystems function, the drivers of their changes and their possible future trajectories.},

abstract = {At the Rio+20 meeting in June 2012, governments of the world committed to rebuilding fish stock sizes by 2015 at least to levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY), even if that would require the temporary closure of fisheries. This study explores the outcomes of such action for European stocks. In 2012, only 8 of 48 stocks (17{\%}) were abundant enough to produce MSY and with a business as usual scenario, this number would not increase by 2015. In contrast, if fishing was reduced to levels consistent with rebuilding and if some fisheries were temporarily closed, 50–70{\%} of the examined stocks would be able to reach the Rio+20 target by the end of 2015. In this scenario, after three years with reduced catches, fish supply from European stocks would reach and exceed the levels of 2011 already in 2016. The implications for fish, fishers and fish consumers are discussed.},

abstract = {In the period of investigation, 1995-2000, the Danish fishery for species meant for human consumption was managed by individual non-transferable vessel quotas, while the fishery for species meant for fishmeal and fish oil was subject to a total quota. The revenues of the fishermen targeting species for human consumption are therefore fixed on the assumption that they are price takers, and that they will maximize profits by minimizing their costs. To model the economic behaviour of the fishermen in terms of the optimal quota size per vessel and optimal fleet size, a dual cost-function approach is an appropriate choice. This method is applied using a generalized Leontief cost function to model the behaviour of the Danish fleet of trawlers below 50 GRT, targeting species for human consumption solely. The estimated cost function is used to determine the optimal quotas yielding: (i) minimum average cost and (ii) maximum profit. The results of the estimations show that the optimal quotas per vessel should be in...},

Fisheries management in the EU, Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand has developed following different paths, despite being based on similar instruments and principles. Iceland, Australia, and New Zealand have been at the forefront of developing management practices such as stakeholder involvement, legally binding management targets (Australia, New Zealand), individual transferable quotas, and discard bans (Iceland, New Zealand). The EU has since the beginning of the 21st century taken significant steps to better involve stakeholders and establish quantitative targets through management plans, and a landing obligation is gradually being implemented from 2015 onward. The management of domestic fisheries resources in Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland has, overall, performed better than in the EU, in terms of conservation and economic efficiency. It should, however, be stressed that, compared to Australia, New Zealand, and Iceland, (i) initial over-capacity was more of an issue in the EU when management measures became legally binding and also that (ii) EU has been progressive in developing common enforcement standards, on stocks shared by sovereign nations. The situation of EU fisheries has substantially improved over the period 2004–2013 in the northeast Atlantic, with fishery status getting close to that in the other jurisdictions, but the lack of recovery for Mediterranean fish stocks remains a concern.},

MPAs directly impact, and are impacted by, the fishing industry and knowing fishers' attitudes towards MPAs is critical for their success. In general, fishing activity is permitted within the boundaries of MPAs in Scotland but with different levels of restrictions, thus impacting differently on different sectors of the fishing industry. The present study used a questionnaire survey to investigate the attitudes towards closed areas of Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears. The results show that different gear-users expressed significantly different opinions about closed areas as management tools, their ability to protect stocks and decrease conflicts. Furthermore, a logistic model revealed that, besides the gear-type fishers operate, other characteristics (educational level, location and perceptions of compliance) influence fishers' opinions about closed areas. Fishers are not a homogeneous collective and the difference in perceptions about closed areas among Scottish inshore fishers operating different gears has important implications for management. Regarding the important role MPAs will play in the long-term conservation and fisheries management plans in Europe, understanding the variability in fishers' attitudes within the same, and between different, groups will facilitate successful planning and management of MPAs. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

This trend is fueled by a widespread perception that large-scale fishing operations are powerful forces altering the structure and function of marine ecosystems. It is acknowledged that management needs to better account for variations in ocean productivity, stock structure, and changing social values. Many countries are contemplating how to improve ocean fishery management. In the United States, fishery management bodies are experiencing pressure to undertake the daunting task of moving from their current single-species management plans to EBFM. Impediments in- clude lack of a clear definition of EBFM, what it entails, or how to proceed. In this paper, characteristics of fishery management that are unique to EBFM are identified. The transition to EBFM needs to be evolutionary rather than revolutionary. A course of action is outlined that can be used to guide this transition. Modeling approaches and metrics useful for planning, implementing, and evaluating EBFM are discussed, with particular emphasis on management strategy evaluation.},

Motivated by the need to further investigate the concept, this paper develops a conceptual framework that explores the effects of brand trust, trust in the food system, consumer confidence and brand loyalty. While most extant studies have examined the brand trust-brand loyalty link, this paper proposes that: (i) the impact of brand trust on consumer confidence in brand attributes is mediated by trust in the food system, and (ii) brand trust leads to brand loyalty via consumer confidence. The proposition is tested using Structural Equation Modelling techniques based on survey data from a sample of Canadian consumers of packaged green salad. Results indicate that in a food context, brand trust is positively associated with consumer confidence in brand quality and safety, largely via trust in the food system. Furthermore, confidence in credence attributes is shown to lead to brand loyalty. While previous research conceived brand trust as a multidimensional construct, the analysis suggests that trust in food brands could be better explained by a one-factor model.},

These experiences demonstrate the importance of legally recognized rights not only as a key tool in resource management, but also in the pursuit of secure and equitable livelihoods on the part of indigenous peoples.

abstract = {Two periods of sustained low recruitment have been observed in North Sea herring in recent history; one from 1971 to 1979 and one that started in 2002 and continued up until the most recent year for which information is available (2010). This paper compares both periods of recruitment depression and considers the possible causes for each of them. The first depression (1971-1979) has been commonly ascribed to insufficient egg production by the depleted parent stock. However, recruitment to the central and northern populations was probably also affected by an environmental factor. There are indications of a reduced Atlantic inflow into the northwestern North Sea at the time of the depression. This could have affected survival of the larvae by slowing down their transport to the nursery areas in the southeastern North Sea. For the second period (2002-2010), the low recruitment has been ascribed to an increase in temperature and/or a regime shift in the ecosystem. An alternative explanation could be predation by the large stock of adult herring on its own larvae.},

This article develops some models to study various aspects of the relationship between market and optimal resource allocation in the presence of some nonconvexities. The monopoly power, which is a necessary ingredient of markets with nonconvexities, is usually considered to distort resources away from the sector concerned. However, in the analysis monopoly power enables firms to pay fixed costs, and entry cannot be prevented, so the relationship between monopoly power and the direction of market distortion is no longer obvious. In the central case of constant elasticity utility function, the market solution was constrained Pareto optimal, regardless of the value of that elasticity.

abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of fishermen is a key ingredient to successful fisheries management. The aggregate behaviour of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race-for-fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done – per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure.},

Common sense and international law underline the prominent role of science in management. Most managers request peer-reviewed advice based on an objective assessment of the impact of fisheries on marine ecosystems, to create a basis for sustainable and profitable fisheries. Management systems in the North Atlantic rely extensively on advice on total allowable catches (TACs) to control fishing mortality in stocks under regulation. This leads to an unhelpful focus on inherently uncertain catch forecasts. With the wisdom of hindsight, TACs have rarely led to the predicted reduction in fishing mortality. And because of the focus on TACs, other elements in the management framework, notably overcapacity and other economic and social constraints, do not receive the necessary attention. A comparison of the way fishing advice is acquired with the same process in the hydrocarbon extraction industry draws attention to the multi-user problem in marine fisheries management.},

By analysing the reform of the CFP by means of the ecosystem-based management framework, we conclude that there is a lack of instruments to deal with the social sustainability objective while economic and ecological sustainability could be simultaneously achieved with the specific measures considered in the reform. Individually analysed, the specific measures could further benefit ecosystem-based management implementation, although not all the observed or analysed consequences of the implementation of these measures move in this direction. In that sense we conclude that the success of the ecosystem based management of EU fisheries depends much more on the specific implementation of the measures and on the accompanying incentives, which in the end, implies that the institutional and political settings will determine its success.},

abstract = {Abstract Scholars of political ecology have long been interested in questions of access, equity, and power in environmental management. This paper explores these domains by examining lived experiences and daily realities in Iceland's fishing communities, 30 years after the implementation of a national privatized Individual Transferrable Quota (ITQ) fisheries management system. Drawing upon ethnographic data collected over 2 years in the rural coastal communities of Northwest Iceland, we address three questions; 1) How the ITQ system relates to other complex social and environmental factors facing coastal communities today. 2) How attempts to alleviate negative impacts of the ITQ system have led to new rifts in communities and 3) how the decision-making power of a few dominant interest groups in national politics leaves small-boat fishermen and rural communities at a disadvantage. In the words of our study participants, the Icelandic fisheries management scheme has created “little kings” in rural communities, where each little king acts in his own best interest, yet has no recourse to collective power and no platform to influence national politics. In this volatile political situation with cross-scale implications, it is difficult for fishermen, their families, and community members to imagine ways in which power over and access to the fisheries resource can be redistributed.

We address some of these perceived barriers by providing guidance on strategies and approaches that can be used for the steps of one ecosystem-based management process, the integrated ecosystem assessment framework, including scoping, defining indicators, setting thresholds, risk analysis, management strategy evaluation, monitoring and evaluation. Importantly, we demonstrate how an ecosystem-based management approach can be utilized in a variety of contexts which vary widely in data quality and availability, governance structure, and time frame. We then illustrate the suggested steps in the process by exploring two case studies that represent realistic ends of the data/governance/time frame spectrum: Puget Sound, Washington, USA and Raja Ampat, Indonesia. By providing concrete suggestions for how to move forward with key steps in an integrated management process, we show that ecosystem-based management is feasible from a range of starting points and that for any given starting point there are numerous productive paths forward.},

This involves defining management objectives and developing simple and efficient tools to achieve an overview of management needs and prioritise among these, while integrating broader conservation issues and ensuring stakeholder involvement. A new Marine Resources Act entered into force in Norway in 2009. By integrating conservation and sustainable use as basic principles, the law represents a paradigm shift in the management of Norwegian fisheries. The law indicates which concerns should be addressed, but neither how nor how often evaluations should take place. That is for management to decide. A management principle in the Marine Resources Act confers on the Ministry an obligation to evaluate whether continued fishing at the present scale is justifiable, or whether improved management is required to ensure sustainability. A Stock table, and a table of “Catches of data-poor species” constitute a comprehensive system for monitoring the management principle. Along with a Fisheries table, these tables establish a framework for developing an ecosystem-based fisheries management by providing a basis and tools for prioritising the needs of new and/or revised management measures.},

This study corrects for this inaccuracy by extending the doubly heteroscedastic stochastic cost frontier suggested by Hadri (1999) to the model for technical inefficiency effects. This model is a stochastic frontier production function for panel data as proposed by Battese and Coelli (1995). The study uses, for illustration of the techniques, data on 101 mainly cereal farms in England. We find that the correction for heteroscedasticity is supported by the data. Both point estimates and confidence intervals for technical efficiencies are provided. The confidence intervals are constructed by extending the "Battese-Coelli" method reported by Horrace and Schmidt (1996) by allowing the technical inefficiency to be time varying and the disturbance terms to be heteroscedastic. The confidence intervals reveal the precision of technical efficiency estimates and show the deficiencies of making inferences based exclusively on point estimates.},

Normal distributions are commonly used in formulating likelihood functions and informative prior distributions; these are sensitive to data outliers and mis-specification of prior distributions, both common problems in fisheries-stock assessment. Using a length-structured stock-assessment model for a New Zealand abalone fishery as an example, we evaluate the robustness of three likelihood functions and two prior-distribution functions, with respect to outliers and mis-specification of priors, in 48 different combinations. The two robust likelihood estimators performed slightly less well when no data outliers were present and much better when data outliers were present. Similarly, the Cauchy distribution was less sensitive to prior mis-specification than the normal distribution. We conclude that replacing the normal distribution with fat-tailed distributions for likelihoods and priors can improve Bayesian assessments when there are data outliers and mis-specification of priors, with relatively minor costs when there are none.},

Does the empirical research on economies of size support for this policy? The objective of this paper is to define the factors affecting economies of size and update the literature since 1980. The best of the cost function studies suggest that sizeable potential cost savings in instructional and administrative costs may exist by moving from a very small district (500 or fewer pupils) to a district with ca 2000–4000 pupils. The findings from production function studies of schools are less consistent, but there is some evidence that moderately sized elementary schools (300–500 students) and high schools (600–900 students) may optimally balance economies of size with the potential negative effects of large schools. Since program evaluation research on school consolidation is limited, it is time for researchers on both sides of this debate to make good evaluation research on consolidation a high priority. In addition, the potential diseconomies of size in large central city school districts needs increased attention in academic research.},

abstract = {This paper deals with the design of modelling tools suitable for investigating the consequences of alternative policies on the dynamics of resources and fisheries, such as the evaluation of marine protected areas (MPA). We first review the numerous models that have been developed for this purpose, and compare them from several standpoints: population modelling, exploitation modelling and management measure modelling. We then present a generic fisheries simulation model, Integration of Spatial Information for FISHeries simulation (ISIS-Fish). This spatially explicit model allows quantitative policy screening for fisheries with mixed-species harvests. It may be used to investigate the effects of combined management scenarios including a variety of policies: total allowable catch (TAC), licenses, gear restrictions, MPA, etc. Fisher's response to management may be accounted for by means of decision rules conditioned on population and exploitation parameters. An application to a simple example illustrates the relevance of this kind of tool for policy screening, particularly in the case of mixed fisheries. Finally, the reviewed models and ISIS-Fish are discussed and confronted in the light of the underlying assumptions and model objectives. In the light of this discussion, we identify desirable features for fisheries simulation models aimed at policy evaluation, and particularly MPA evaluation.},

Building on Results Based Management principles, RFMS involves the definition of specific and measurable objectives for a fishery by the relevant authorities but allows resource users the freedom to find ways to achieve the objectives and to provide adequate documentation. Taking into account the main goals of the new Common Fisheries Policy, such as sustainable utilization of the resources, end of discards and unwanted catches, a management plan for the Portuguese crustacean trawl fishery was developed in cooperation with the fishing industry, following the process and design laid out in the RFMS concept. The plan considers biological, social and economic goals and assigns a responsibility for increased data collection to the resource users. The performance of the plan with regard to selected indicators was evaluated through simulations. In this paper the process towards a RFMS is described and the lessons learnt from the interaction with stakeholders in the development of an alternative management plan are discussed.},

This paper considers the impacts of these policy changes on government and within the fishing communities around Lake Chiuta whose fisheries co-management experience is considered successful. Benefits to the communities range from gaining government support in excluding non-local fishers using destructive fishing gear to increased household incomes and improved livelihoods, while benefits to government range from taking credit for establishing a sustainable fishery and co-management arrangements to reduced resource management costs. Community costs include financial resources and time spent by resource user representative organisations in enforcing fishing regulations. These findings enable a more balanced assessment of neoliberal claims about the benefits of delegating management responsibilities and downloading costs of management onto fishing communities and organisations.},

abstract = {Policy recommendations concerning optimal scale of production units may have serious implications for the restructuring of a sector. The piecewise linear frontier production function framework (DEA) is becoming the most popular one for assessing not only technical efficiency of operations, but also for scale efficiency and calculation of optimal scale sizes. The main purpose of the present study is to investigate if neoclassical production theory gives any guidance as to the nature of scale properties in the DEA model, and empirically explore such properties. Theoretical results indicate that the DEA model may have more irregular properties than usually assumed in neoclassical production theory, concerning shape of optimal scale curves and the M-locus. The empirical results indicate that optimal scale may be found over almost the entire size variations in outputs and inputs, thus making policy recommendations about efficient scale difficult. It seems necessary to establish the nature of optimal scale before any practical conclusions can be drawn. Proposals for indexes characterizing the nature of optimal scale are provided.},

There were significant differences in diet composition between areas and some differences between years. The importance of krill in the Barents Sea increased with latitude and krill dominated the Spitsbergen diet. Capelin dominated the diet around Bear Island and contributed considerably to the diet along the coast of northern Norway. In the latter area, herring and haddock were also a great part of the diet. The diet in the Norwegian Sea consisted of mainly mature herring, while the diet in the North Sea was dominated by sand eels and mackerel.

Our interpre tation is that much of the increase in wage inequality for males over the last 20 years is due to increased returns to the components of skill other than years of schooling and years of labor market experi ence.

abstract = {The performance of the EU long-term management plan for cod stocks, in force since 2009, is analysed focusing on the human and institutional factors. The plan operates through landings quotas (TACs) and effort restrictions following a Harvest Control Rule, and deploys a novel instrument allowing Member States to ‘buy back' or increase fishing effort for fleet segments engaged in cod-avoidance measures. The stipulated fishing mortality reductions have not been achieved. On the positive side, the ‘buy-back' instrument has led to increased uptake of selective gear and implementation of permanent and real-time temporary closures. On the negative side, ignoring the dimension of fishers as reactive agents in the design, the impact assessment, and the annual implementation of the measures has contributed to the failure to adequately implement the plan and achieve its objectives. The main problem is that the landings quotas taken in a mixed fishery did not limit catches because fishers were incentivised to continue fishing and discard overquota catch while quota for other species was available. The effort limitations intended to reduce this effect were insufficient to adequately limit fishing mortality in targeted fisheries, although fishers experienced them as prohibiting the full uptake of other quotas. Recommendations for future plans include (i) management through catch rather than landings quotas, (ii) the internalisation of the costs of exceeding quotas, (iii) use of more selective gear types, (iv) the development of appropriate metrics as a basis for regulatory measures and for evaluations, (v) participatory governance, (vi) fishery-based management, (vii) flexibility in fishing strategy at vessel level.},

@article{Arnason2000a,
abstract = {This paper deals with a special class of fisheries models referred to as endogenous optimizationmodels. The distinctive feature of these models is that behaviour of the agents in the model is not predetermined by exogenous behavioural rules. In endogenous optimization models, the model agents are merely furnished with objectives such as profit or utility maximization. Given these objectives and the various constraints determined by the state of the model at each point of time, the agents solve their maximization problem. The corresponding values of their control variables then constitute their behaviour. Having generated individual agents' behaviour by endogenous optimization, summing over agents yields aggregate behaviour. Aggregate behaviour must conform with the overall constraints of the model, be they physical or otherwise. Within the market system, individual behaviour or rather plans are made compatible via changes in relative prices. Therefore, outside equilibrium, behavioural plans must be repeatedly modified to become mutually compatible. This implies iteratively solving the maximization problem of a number of different agents. Endogenous optimization models therefore tend to be computationally very demanding. Clearly, the basic principles of endogenous optimization are just as applicable to any model involving maximizing agents.},

abstract = {Managing fish stocks in terms of a portfolio of economic assets is likely to significantly increase benefits for society relative to single-species approaches. A portfolio framework systematically combines fish stocks that are joined by ecology (e.g., predation, competition) and unspecialized fishing technologies (e.g., mixed-species trawls) into a portfolio which balances expected aggregate returns against the risks associated with stock-attribute and other uncertainties. To be productive, however, this framework must be combined with property rights institutions that clearly state management objectives, create long-run time-horizons among harvesters, internalize spillovers caused by ecological and technological jointness, and reduce uncertainty through research and adaptive management. Although the cost of reducing scientific uncertainty about ecological interactions may limit the portfolio approach to intensive management of relatively few species, its scope can be broadened to integrate tradeoffs among more types of marine resources, such as nature preserves and oil and gas deposits.},

abstract = {Fisheries-dependent and independent data have a strong spatial component. These data are also multi-dimensional, making them difficult to visualize and analyze, prompting the use of spatial analysis to facilitate an understanding of their relationships. One aspect of fisheries data that is often ignored is the distribution and abundance of a particular resource and the fishing patterns of its harvesting fisheries. In order to improve management advice, stock assessors need to incorporate the spatial component of these data into an existing assessment framework. This paper presents a three-dimensional visualization of the age-structure and fishery dependent and independent data associated with the sparid fish Pterogymnus laniarius on the Agulhas Bank, South Africa. A spatially-referenced spawner biomass per-recruit model is developed to illustrate the applicability of incorporating spatially referenced information in providing management advice. The model provided evidence that, even on a spatial scale, fishing mortality is significantly correlated to fishing effort. Areas of high levels of spawner biomass are noted, all of which corresponded to those geographic areas with a combination of low fishing effort and high adult biomass.

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Quota allocation mechanisms have distributional effects that are highly relevant to the economic orga-nization of fisheries. In France, where fishing allocations are non-transferable, quotas are shared among Producer Organizations (POs) based on the historical landings of their members. Each PO is then respon-sible for implementing their own internal rules that provide individual or collective allocations to their members. This study investigates the distributional effects of the various quota management systems adopted by POs on quotas and production for the Bay of Biscay sole fishery. A comparison between initial allocations by vessel based on historical landings and actual observed landings is presented. Inequality metrics are used to quantify distributional effects, and a new method that is based on the decompos-ability property of the Theil index is introduced. Results show that the French management system successfully avoided concentration of production while reducing the fishing capacity through decom-missioning schemes. The non-transferability of fishing allocations is a critical element that favored this outcome by allowing POs to control the distribution of catch shares in the fishery. Besides, it appears that the allocation strategies developed by POs were notably influenced by their local roots and their fishing fleet profiles. The various quota allocation systems among POs had contrasting effects on vessels' production, including greater equity within particular subfleets, benefits to vessels most dependent on sole in most POs, and benefits to the small-scale fisheries in a few POs.},

abstract = {Harvesting regulations for crustacean decapods generally focus on total catch and minimum legal size of individuals. However, there are trade-offs between total catch and minimum size, and possibly also for maximum size. The outcome of various harvesting restrictions was assessed by model iterations for one lake based on a long time series (29 years) of crayfish population size and annual harvesting. The paper explores how this decline might have been avoided by alternative harvest regulations based on a strong decline in the surveyed population and use of a deterministic model with two stable equilibria. The results of the model simulations suggested that the decline may have been avoided by reducing the annual catches by 15{\%} without changing the minimum size regulation of 95 mm. The decline may also have been avoided by protecting the largest (and most fecund) individuals, e. g. by allowing harvesting of crayfish between 50 and 98 mm without reducing the total catches. The latter strategy might also have counteracted a long-term evolution towards smaller crayfish caused by selective harvesting of the largest individuals.},

The CDQ program evolved from a partial catch share pro- gram that existed from 1992 to 1999 within a limited-entry fishery to a full catch share program with separate spatial rights. In this paper I examine the temporal and spatial uses of CDQ rights and how these uses have changed since the implementation of catch shares throughout the fishery. I also discuss the dispersion of CDQ royalties since the program's inception and examine the prices ofCDQfishing rights from 1992 to 2005 when data on quota value were reported to the government. I compare quota prices to information about walleye pollock fishing and examine the evolving use of CDQ rights. The use of the CDQ right has changed from extending the season to enabling fishing in otherwise closed areas during the season. The number of vessels fishing with CDQrights has declined substantially, with all pollockCDQ fishing now done by at-sea processors.},

As well, social goals of equity and fairness in fisheries have re-emerged as priorities alongside the goals of ecological sustainability and economic efficiency. This study aims to address the past and present state of the concentration of fishing licenses in British Columbia's salmon and herring fisheries. Fisheries administrative data from federal and provincial data sets were mined to develop a timeline of fisheries ownership and control over a twenty-year period. Hidden corporate ownership of licenses through subsidiaries was identified and comprehensive criteria were co-identified with industry representatives to characterize the various user groups of fisheries licenses. Our analysis suggests that from 1993 to 2012, there was a notable shift in the ownership profile of salmon and herring licenses, with a marked increase in concentration of licenses owned by fish processors.},

behaviorally targeted advertising, yet little is known about whether and how information used for

privacy norms presumed in the marketing exchange relationship to consumer trust and

considered outside the marketing exchange norms and a violation of trust. In fact, the results
show that selling information to an ad network is considered on par with the security violation of
a hacker stealing information in violating trust. In addition, an experiment shows respondents are
less willing to engage with a partner violating privacy norms of the marketing exchange by
utilizing pervasive tracking. These studies illustrate how the interests of consumer-facing firms,
who maintain an important exchange relationship with consumers, may not be aligned with the
interests of ad networks and data aggregators who benefit from pervasive consumer tracking and

The standard theory of total factor productivity (TFP) is extended to accommodate the special case of the fisheries where the size of the fish stocks represents a major input into the production process. Utilizing aggregative time series data on the Icelandic fisheries from 1974-1995, a T{\"{o}}rnquist approximation to the appropriate Divisia index is employed to obtain estimates of changes in total factor productivity in the Icelandic fisheries. According to these measurements the average annual growth in total factor productivity has been quite high during this period compared to that of other major industries in Iceland and abroad. Moreover, there are no signs that this growth in total factor productivity has abated over time. Indeed, it seems to have increased during the latter half of the period. It is tempting to associate this experience with the impact of the ITQ fisheries management which became the dominant form of fisheries management in Iceland during this period.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the development of ITQs in Norway. Even if some would deny that anything such exists, fisheries management in Norway has some unmistakable characteristics of an ITQ system. Both boatowners and policy makers have discovered the attractions of transferable quotas, the former as a means to increase their private profits, the latter as a vehicle to reduce fleet overcapacity. The slow evolution of transferability is mainly the result of ideological opposition and opposition to structural changes, the latter involving falling number of fishermen, changes in location of the fishing industry, and changed composition of the fishing fleet. The development of this system in the purse seine fleet and the fleet fishing for cod and similar species is traced. Then the concept of resource rent is discussed, as well as how it has become capitalized in quota values, which show up as a rise in value of long term assets of the fishing industry.},

In particular, it fails to generate the negative correlation between vacancies and unemployment in the data, i.e., the Beveridge curve. Introducing real wage rigidity leads to a negative correlation, and increases the magnitude of labor market flows to more realistic values. However, inflation dynamics are only weakly affected by real wage rigidity. The reason is that labor market frictions give rise to long-run employment relationships. The measure of real marginal costs that is relevant for inflation in the Phillips curve contains a present value component that varies independently of the real wage. {\textcopyright}2006 Elsevier B.V.

This experiment comes at a particularly important time, since emission trading is under serious consideration, with strong U.S. backing, for use to deal with global climate change by curbing emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2).

@article{Calmfors1994,
abstract = {In recent years, there has been a growing interest in so called active labour market policy as a means of fighting the persistent unemployment in Western Europe. This is easy to understand in view of the disillusionment with more aggregate policies. On the one hand, traditional demand stimulation faces the risk of primarily increasing inflation with only small effects on employment; on the other hand, supply-side structural reforms in order to remove various labour market rigidities have either been difficult to implement or appear to produce only slow results. In this situation, active labour market policy seems to be regarded by many as the deus ex machina that will provide the solution to the unemployment problem. It is the purpose of this paper to make a realistic appraisal. There exist many different interpretations of the concept of active labour market policy. Here I shall use a narrow definition: measures in order to improve the functioning of the labour market that are directed towards the unemployed. Active labour market policy will then comprise three basic subcategories: i) job broking with the purpose of making the matching process between vacancies and job seekers more efficient; ii) labour market training in order to upgrade and adapt the skills of job applicants; and iii) direct job creation, which may take the form of either public-sector employment or subsidisation of private-sector work. Each type of labour market policy may work through several different chan- nels. It is another aim of this paper to structure the various effects with the help of a simple analytical framework and to use that to highlight the crucial determinants of policy effectiveness.The discussion is organised as follows. Section I presents the basic analytical framework. Section II is an attempt to structure the various types of effects, whereas Section 111 discusses the possibilities to draw conclusions on the effect of active labour market policy from existing empirical knowledge. Section IV focuses on the importance of various design features. Section V concludes.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T The individual transferable quotas (ITQ) system is a popular fisheries management system applied in many countries. Here, vessels are scrapped or sold out of the fishery, and their quotas are transferred to the remaining vessels, resulting in lower number of active vessels. This consequently reduces the overcapacity of fishing fleets and likely improves financial performance. Unlike previous studies, this paper quantifies the impact of capacity adjustment on vessel profitability through an econometric model. Supply and demand shifters are included in the model to isolate the influence of capacity adjustment. The case studies are the total Norwegian fishing fleet and an important vessel group – the ocean-going cod trawlers. Empirical findings generally indicate a positive impact of capacity adjustment on vessel financial performance. The observed recent decline in financial prof-itability of the fishing fleet may therefore be attributed to other factors rather than overcapacity.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t The reduction of discards in European fisheries has been identified as a specific objective of the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. To reduce the uncertainty in catch data and the socially unacceptable waste of resources that results from the disposal of catch at sea, a policy to ban discards has been proposed. Discard bans are currently implemented in Alaska, British Columbia, New Zealand, the Faroe Islands, Norway and Iceland. Experience from these countries highlights that a policy of mandatory landings can result in a reduction in discards, but relies upon a high level of surveillance or economic incentives to encourage fishers to land more of their catch. Discard bans will also not result in long term benefits to stocks unless total removals are reduced, through the avoidance of undersized, non-commercial or over quota catch. Experience shows that additional management measures are required to incentivise such a move towards more selective fishing. Success has resulted from the use of area closures and bycatch limits, with potential applications in EU fisheries. However, selective fishing will not be a panacea for the current state of European fisheries; discard bans and accompanying measures must be embedded in a wider management system that constrains fishing mortality to reasonable levels before sustainable exploitation can occur.},

Still, the substantial variation in duration by product form and factors influencing it, indicates heterogeneous dynamics for each supply chain even for slight differences in the characteristics of a commodity. Moreover, the short duration of trade relationships in the supply chains for Norwegian cod indicates that they remain very traditional food supply chains, with few attempts at reducing transaction costs through vertical coordination or relationships.},

What are their roles and responsibilities in the chain of governance? What are the specific characteristics of each country, and what is similar and what is different as compared with other sectors? Although there is a move towards devolvement and decentralisation in some European countries, there is quite an ambivalence regarding such reforms in other countries. These differences in stakeholder involvement are partly a result of institutional traditions within each country, but also a reflection of how management authorities struggle with the dilemmas pertaining to such reforms of participatory practices. Thus, we argue that even within a reformed fisheries management system that allows greater participation of stakeholder groups, there can hardly be one European model that fits all. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Whaling and sealing in the Barents Sea are of little economic interest of themselves, but might impact some other fisheries positively. Our model to evaluate strategies for whaling and sealing includes cod, herring, capelin, harp seals and minke whales, and emphasizes interactions between these populations caused by predation. For proposed management strategies, the stochastic system is repeatedly simulated over 100 years, and the strategies are evaluated by the resulting cod, capelin and herring TACs that are calculated from fixed rules. Our line of study was first pursued in the 1990s with an emphasis on management strategies for cod, herring and minke whales. It is now extended and refined with harp seals included, and with improved modelling of how predation mortality in the fish species is non-linearly linked to the abundances of all the modelled species.},

abstract = {We examine changes in the characteristics of American youth between the late 1970s and the late 1990s, with a focus on characteristics that matter for labor market success. The current generation is more skilled than the previous one. Blacks and Hispanics have gained relative to whites, and women have gained relative to men. However, the skill distribution has widened overall. Shifts in parental education generate many of the observed changes. We also provide speculative estimates suggesting that if recent trends in technology and the supply of human capital continue, wage inequality will increase substantially by 2025.

abstract = {The sustainability in the integrated human and nature systems or social–ecological systems (SES) of reef fishery needs attention, because the livelihood of many coastal communities is dependent upon it. Likewise, coral reef ecosystem is important marine resource as a source of biodiversity, a spawning aggregation for various reef fish and biota. However, coral reef ecosystem in South Sulawesi has been pressured by reef-related fishing activities, which include destructive practices of bomb and poison fishing. This study assesses the cond ition of fishery sustainability in five selected small islands situated in Taka Bonerate Marine National Park and Spermonde Archipelago, South Sulawesi. Multi-criteria analysis (MCA) is used as a decision-making tool to analyze and evaluate multiple indicators under a participatory group decision-making environment (Mendoza and Prabhu 2004). Four variable criteria of sustainability indicators are included, namely ecological-criterion indicators, economic-criterion indicators, social-criterion indicators, and instit utional-criterion indicato rs. The result of the assessment is analyzed with the state of coral reef and the state of destructive fishery in the area},

abstract = {This paper surveys the current state and major trends in global fisheries; the environmental and social dimensions of fisheries; and explains how the international community has tried to meet the policy challenges associated with oceans and fisheries. The ocean and the freshwater ecosystems of the world make significant contributions to people's well-being via the many vital social and environmental services they provide (for example, food and nutrition, employment and incomes, carbon cycling and sequestration). The impact that the increase in fishing since the 1950s has had on wild fish stocks, and the significant increase in aquaculture production in the 20th century, have resulted in severe environmental impacts. This has significant effects on marine ecosystems and the health of oceans. The erosion of the resource undermines communities' long-term interests, including food security, employment, and income. Attempts by the global community to address challenges of sustainable production by improving the governance and management of fisheries resources range from national management of fisheries resources, to regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) for international fisheries stocks. These attempts have not always successfully met the challenge of balancing current and future use of fisheries.},

Using this separation between quantity and quality, a reference frontier representing best practice among the schools is established by Data Envelopment Analysis, and the technical efficiencies are measured. The schools have very different student achievements, but the variation is not related to differences in resource use. The school system is oriented towards the equalization of student results, but the schools show systematic differences in the handling of high and low achievers.},

@article{Kiker2005,
abstract = {Decision making in environmental projects can be complex and seemingly intractable, principally because of the inherent trade-offs between sociopolitical, environmental, ecological, and economic factors. The selection of appropriate remedial and abatement strategies for contaminated sites, land use planning, and regulatory processes often involves multiple additional criteria such as the distribution of costs and benefits, environmental impacts for different populations, safety, ecological risk, or human values. Some of these criteria cannot be easily condensed into a monetary value, partly because environmental concerns often involve ethical and moral principles that may not be related to any economic use or value. Furthermore, even if it were possible to aggregate multiple criteria rankings into a common unit, this approach would not always be desirable because the ability to track conflicting stakeholder preferences may be lost in the process. Consequently, selecting from among many different alternatives often involves making trade-offs that fail to satisfy 1 or more stakeholder groups. Nevertheless, considerable research in the area of multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) has made available practical methods for applying scientific decision theoretical approaches to complex multicriteria problems. This paper presents a review of the available literature and provides recommendations for applying MCDA techniques in environmental projects. A generalized framework for decision analysis is proposed to highlight the fundamental ingredients for more structured and tractable environmental decision making.},

abstract = {Economists have long been puzzled by the observations that during peacetime industrial market economies display recurrent, large fluctuations in output and employment over relatively short time periods. Not uncommon are changes as large as 10 percent within only a couple of years. These observations are con-sidered puzzling because the associated movements in labor's marginal product are small. These observations should not be puzzling, for they are what standard economic theory predicts. For the United States, in fact, given people's ability and willing-ness to intertemporally and intratemporally substitute consumption and leisure and given the nature of the changing production possibility set, it would be puz-zling if the economy did not display these large fluctua-tions in output and employment with little associated fluctuations in the marginal product of labor. Moreover, standard theory also correctly predicts the amplitude of these fluctuations, their serial correlation proper-ties, and the fact that the investment component of out-put is about six times as volatile as the consumption component. This perhaps surprising conclusion is the principal finding of a research program initiated by Kydland and me (1982) and extended by Kydland and me (1984), Hansen (1985a), and Bain (1985). We have computed the competitive equilibrium stochastic process for variants of the constant elasticity, stochastic growth model. The elasticities of substitution and the share parameters of the production and utility functions are restricted to those that generate the growth observa-tions. The process governing the technology parameter is selected to be consistent with the measured tech-nology changes for the American economy since the Korean War. We ask whether these artificial econo-mies display fluctuations with statistical properties similar to those which the American economy has dis-played in that period. They do.},

For golden redfish in Icelandic waters, length distributions and abundance indices are available both from commercial catch and from surveys, particularly a groundfish survey in March. This paper addresses the use of an age- and length-based cohort model for the assessment of redfish, where all selection curves depend on the length of the fish and information on age is not a prerequisite but can be utilised if available. In the last few years it appears that ageing of this species has been successful and in this paper we compare assessment results of a model that incorporates age information with those that do not. Finally, we calculate yield per recruit, Fmax and F0.1 for the stock. Stock size, catch and fishing mortality are then simulated 10 years ahead using different catch control laws$\backslash$n},

abstract = {Icelandic fisheries have gone through tremendous changes since the 1980s and the gradual implementation of individual transferable quotas. The paper investigates to what extent the power of different stakeholders in the fisheries management system has changed, and examines whether and in which fields enhanced participation is favoured by relevant stakeholder groups. Strengths and weaknesses of participation within the system are scrutinized and alternatives assessed. The analytical framework stems from the concept of adaptive co-management, whereas the empirical data derives from a survey on Icelandic fisheries management among important stakeholder groups. This survey showed that the critique of individual transferable quotas is not homogeneous. Regional differences are present regarding the evaluation of the current regime, but also of proposed alternative management instruments. Overall, more stakeholder participation, especially in data gathering and decision making, is demanded. This has in fact decreased over time. The authors suggest that the perceived shortcomings of the quota system in general and the lack of stakeholder participation in particular, can be addressed by adopting certain elements of adaptive co-management.},

The successful effort by the Haida Nation to protect herring stocks ultimately required a combination of strategies involving confrontation, negotiation and litigation that occurred across two manage-ment scales (local and coast-wide) and two levels of dispute resolution. Strategies were successful as a result of four key factors: (a) ongoing conservation concerns about probable harm to herring populations, (b) the existence of aboriginal rights that raises standards for federal government consultation and accommodation, (c) an existing negotiated co-management agreement between the Haida and Canada about the area where most herring stocks are located, and (d) strategic interactions among local and coast-wide forums where herring closures were debated.},

They provide instructions on towing methods and exact data on locations and other information on the tows. Further- more, the manuals include appendices describing certain side projects or methods. The manuals are written in Icelandic, since the projects are almost exclusively carried out by Icelandic fis- hermen and scientists. Due to increased collaboration with foreign scientists, e.g. within ICES, the need for English versions of the manuals has increased. English versions are also needed because of the increased usage of survey data in various research published in international scientific journals. Here, the manuals of the two projects; “The Icelandic Groundfish Survey in spring 2009” and “The Icelandic Autumn Groundfish Survey 2009” have been translated to English. The methodology of these projects in the preceding years has been more or less similar to what is described here for the year 2009.},

abstract = {The European common fisheries policy (CFP) advocates measures to sustain small-scale fisheries; hence, in the European Commission's proposal for a reformed CFP, these are exempted from a mandatory system with tradable fishing concessions. This opens up for management actions designed for small-scale fisheries, but also implies new management issues. This article provides insights into the topic based on a Swedish small-scale herring fishery in the western Baltic Sea that was exempted from an ITQ-system. The fishery has been profitable since the system was introduced, and the increasing effort of both incumbent fishermen and new entrants implies a situation where fishermen compete for a limited quota. The migratory pattern of the herring implies high densities in the southern parts of the fishing areas during spring and in the northern parts during autumn. This forms the basis for two different fisheries in the area, as well as for the current management proposal to divide the quota into a spring and an autumn part. This and other management proposals are discussed in the paper. The main conclusion from the case study is that, when exempting a fishery from tradable fishing concessions, it is important to build other institutions dealing with the fundamental problem of access to the quota. Failure to do so might result in an over-capacity issue and threaten the long-run development of an otherwise successful small-scale fishery.},

We demonstrate that adopting the (t-T) efficiency functional form used by BC can, in a model which allows for firm specific patterns of temporal inefficiency variation (as developed by. Cuesta, 2000), results in counter intuitive 'falling-off' of efficient firms in the final sample year. This motivates us to look at a more general parameterisation. First we show that the choice of a function within the first order exponential class is only an issue for the Cuesta model; in the BC model, parameter estimates and inefficiency estimates are invariant to the form. Second we apply the more general model to a railways dataset and find that this model does not seem to suffer from the most efficient firms falling off the frontier. We discuss how to test restrictions in order to make the model more parsimonious, thus preserving the attractive property of the Cuesta model, namely the ability to test for firm specific patterns of inefficiency variation. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The focus of this article is to clarify the meaning of international competitiveness at the country level within in the context of Porter's (1990a) thesis that countries, like companies, compete in international markets for their fair share of the world markets. At a country level, there are two schools of thought on country competitiveness: the economic school, which rejects Porter's notion of country competitiveness, and the management school, which supports the notion of competitiveness at a country level. This article reviews and contrasts the theories pertaining to these two schools of thought with specifi c reference to trade theories and the ‘theory' of the competitive advantage of nations originally advanced by Porter (1990a, 1997a, 1998b, 1998c, 2000). Although Porter's Diamond Framework has been extensively discussed in the management literature, its actual contribution to the body of knowledge in the economic and management literature has never been clarified. The purpose of this article is to explain why Porter's Diamond Framework is not a new theory that explains the competitiveness of countries but rather a framework that enhances our understanding of the international competitiveness of firms.},

I study a three-player coalitional game where Shapley value is used as a solution concept. The results show that full cooperation is a stable solution of the game, that is, no country finds it optimal to leave the grand coalition. However, it is further shown how full cooperation may become unstable under biological uncertainty. Therefore, I propose a simple mechanism to alleviate the problem. The instability created by biological uncertainty can be significantly reduced when simple modified cooperative strategies are applied. By introducing a safe minimum biological level for the fish stock (SMBL) below which no harvesting takes place and also changing gear selectivities, instability reduces a great deal. However, a safe minimum economic level (SMEL) when there may be perfect stability is shown to be higher than the SMBL.},

SUMMARY This paper proposes and tests new definitions of convergence and common trends for per capita output. We define convergence for a group of countries to mean that each country has identical long-run trends, either stochastic or deterministic, while common trends allow for proportionality of the stochastic elements. These definitions lead naturally to the use of cointegration techniques in testing. Using century-long time series for 15 OECD economies, we reject convergence but find substantial evidence for common trends. Smaller samples of European countries also reject convergence but are driven by a lower number of common stochastic trends.},

abstract = {Increasingly, stock assessments for hard-to-age species such as crabs, prawns, rock lobsters, and abalone are being based on integrated size-structured population dynamics models that are fit to a variety of data sources. These data sources include tagging data to inform growth. Diagnostic statistics and plots have been developed to explore how well integrated population models fit the data types typically used for assessment purposes (index data, size- and age-compositions, and conditional age-at-length data). However, such statistics and plots are not available for tagging data, when these data are used to estimate growth. This paper outlines two diagnostic statistics that can be used to evaluate fits to tagging data, and develops a method based on ‘Francis weighting' for weighting tagging data in integrated models. For illustration, the methods are applied to Aleutian Islands golden king crab (Lithodes aequispinus) in Alaska, and tiger prawns (Penaeus semisulcatus and P. esculentus) in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery. Some degree of growth model mis-specification was revealed for P. semisulcatus, and there were conflicts in the data for the tiger prawns. The standard errors for the estimates of mature male biomass for golden king crab were larger when the tagging data were downweighted based on the proposed weighting method. This serves to emphasise that assessments and their interpretations can be impacted by how tagging data are weighted.},

We introduce the Faroese fisheries effort management system for cod, haddock and saithe, which represents an innovative attempt to tackle the challenges of mixed fisheries by means of a combination of total allowable effort implemented through days-at-sea and extensive use of closed or limited access areas. Subsequently, we present and discuss controversies concerning the system's ability (or lack thereof) to achieve a level of fishing effort that produces long-term sustainability. Over the years the system has proved able to evolve and overcome challenges, and the Faroe Islands are currently considering adding a proper fisheries management plan to the system to achieve fishing at maximum sustainable yield. However, finding support for this plan presents a challenge due particularly to an enduring gap between the perspectives of scientists and actors in the catching sector. Finally, we outline some actions that could be taken to reduce the gap and hence facilitate reform of the system: 1) integration of the consultative/advisory process; 2) obtaining tailor-made advice for the Faroese effort management system from the relevant scientific body; 3) establishment of a transparent mechanism for monitoring and regulating fishing effort; 4) clarifying the efficacy of the prevalent system of closed areas.},

We use information technology and tools to increase productivity and facilitate new forms of scholarship. For more information about JSTOR, please contact support@jstor.org. The management of marine fisheries needs to undergo dramatic change in the new millennium, in response to the well-documented evidence of global overfishing and the general depletion of commercial fish stocks. The axioms of sustainable development and equilibrium productivity of wild ecosystems are identified as misleading concepts, which nonetheless underlie current approaches to the management of living marine resources. Current trends in marine fisheries landings worldwide provide little evidence of sustainability of marine resources under current management paradigms, where biological, economic and social aspects of fisheries are usually treated as different disciplines. While open-access conditions are less widespread than formerly, except for many straddling and highly migratory resources, fishers usually have access to the resource year-round throughout its range. Despite quotas, the nominal control of capacity and technical measures protecting juveniles, top-down management has generally been unable to prevent stock depletion, particularly of the older spawners that for demersal stocks often support recruitment. An integrated solution to the complexity of managing wild resources seems not to have been achieved. Any new paradigm should assert the basic unpredictability of fisheries at the system level and require a broader range of performance indicators to be incorporated into the decisional framework. This must reflect the non-equilibrium nature of marine systems, and give greater importance to resource (as opposed to harvest) continuity in the face of regime shifts, and promote habitat restoration and conservation of genetic resources. The new management framework requires co-management and collective decision-making to be incorporated within a precautionary and pre-negotiated management framework. This must explicitly recognize that decision-making occurs in conditions of model-based uncertainty and precautionary approaches should be incorporated at all levels, not least of which is to avoid the assumption that all resources can be harvested in a sustainable fashion through time. Redundancy in data inputs to management are needed to avoid the surprises that model-based sampling occasionally leads to, for example, when regime changes reduce productivity in response to climatic fluctuations. Emergency frameworks imposing non-dis-cretionary rules must be invoked when overfishing and/or regime change trigger reference points indicating stock depletion. Non-discretionary recovery plans should then override rights-based systems and persist until fish populations recover to pre-established healthy levels, which may in turn need to await the return of a favourable regime. In fact, some stocks may require periodic rebuilding after regime-induced collapses or because of a combination of ecological or economic impacts, hence a constant harvest policy may not always be poss-ible. It will probably also be necessary to discard the axiom that a stock should be available to harvesting throughout its range and seasonal cycle. Technological advances mean that time-and area-specific access rights are now practical options, through satellite monitoring of vessel operations, even offshore. More fundamentally, the basic axiom of 'enlightened self interest' underlying current methods of manage-ment will need to be tempered by an increased ethical concern for the fragility of natural ecosystems.},

Agents obtain utility from both resource use and from behaving according to a norm of quota compliance. The users can exceed their quota at the risk of being detected and formally punished, but they also risk informal sanctions in the form of social disapproval and guilt. I find that when accounting for informal enforcement, there is an indirect effect of regulatory change in addition to the intended direct effect. When policy change, such as tougher enforcement, makes individuals more compliant, the norm of compliance is gradually strengthened, which in turn induces more compliant behavior. I study the implications of policy change on compliance level, quota prices, and the norm of compliance, and show how the properties of the punishment function have important implications for the outcome. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

We report and expand on an analysis of {\textgreater}11,000 fisheries worldwide, in which we investigated the causes of fisheries collapse from 1950 to 2003.

abstract = {Utilization of geothermal energy has played a major role in the energy supply of Iceland for many decades. The country's geological characteristics related to its location on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have endowed the country with an abundant supply of geothermal resources. The share of geothermal energy in the primary energy supply of Iceland is about 68{\%}. The utilization of geothermal water for house heating and other direct uses started early in the twentieth century. Space heating is by far the most important direct utilization, covering 90{\%} of all energy used for house heating in the country. Other sectors of direct use are swimming pools, snow melting, industry, greenhouses and fish farming. The total annual direct use of geothermal energy is estimated to be about 26,700 TJ (7,417 GWh). Geothermal electricity generation started 45 years ago and after a rapid growth during the last 15 years, mainly due to increased demand in the energy intensive industry, it has now reached 29{\%} of the total electricity generation in the country. The total installed capacity is now 663 MWe and the annual generation about 5,245 GWh. After a brief description of the geological background of geothermal utilization in Iceland and the main characteristics of the geothermal resources the paper discusses each of the utilization sectors as well as ongoing research activities and prospects for future development.},

abstract = {The economics of enforcement is traditionally modelled using rational agents assumed to act according to their expected economic utility. In this investigation we derive this expectation by implementing a stochastic simulation model to integrate across associated levels of uncertainty using Monte Carlo. The model is developed for the South Georgia toothfish longline fishery, in which legal catches are strictly managed according to the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) conservation measures. Assuming full compliance in the legal fishery, this investigation deals with the role of a fishing patrol vessel (FPV) in excluding illegal fishing vessels. Both legal and illegal fleets are dynamic. For the legal fleet, catch is set by a harvest control rule within the model framework, with vessels leaving if fishing becomes unprofitable. The illegal catch is determined by the number of vessels operating, which predicts catch on the basis of an estimated production function. The exit of illegal vessels is determined by the probability of detection by the FPV, which is a function of days spent on patrol, and estimated profits. The entry of illegal vessels occurs at a fixed mean rate, with the model integrating over uncertainty in this parameter. An obvious trade off exists in that higher levels of illegal activity lead to lower expected returns to the legal fleet. We thus provide a cost-benefit framework for investigating the trade-offs associated with decisions on enforcement in the fishery, and confirm that current enforcement effort levels are well justified. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

The main findings of this paper are that risks related to policy, management and control are most frequently cited by fishermen in the case study countries. These risks are followed by economic, trade and market issues and fishing impact on environment and resources. The risk perceptions of fishermen in the three countries often vary, and the results indicate that ‘policy, management and control' risks identified by fishermen operating under an ITQ system were assigned more importance than by those involved in a TAE system. A comparison of scalar values shows that fishermen operating under a TAE system tend to attach more importance to risks relating to the impact of fishing on natural resources. The paper contributes to the analysis of risk within fishing and may assist in the creation of better fishing management regulations.},

Our goal was to determine the estimability of various parameters, particularly M, q, and L-50.

The estimate is obtained by fitting a population dynamics model to all available sources of data on Barents Sea harp seals, but because of a lack of information about several key parameters in the model, the uncertainty associated with the estimate is large.

abstract = {Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.},

abstract = {A multispecies spatial model is proposed for evaluation of trawl management strategies and tested with data from British Columbia groundfish. Minimum stock sizes are estimated for 16 species using spatial catch per unit effort data; these data indicate that only small proportions of most stocks are exposed to fishing at any time and that exchange rates of fish between the grounds and other habitats are rapid. A gravity model for spatial effort allocation predicts substantial side effects of marine protected areas or discarding of particular species on nontarget species/grounds due to redistribution of fishing effort. Multispecies, multiground delay-difference models are used in conjunction with the gravity model for spatial effort distribution to predict long-term population responses to various regulatory strategies. This simulation suggests that species composition and spatial structure of the fishery are changing slowly due to reduction in abundance of long-lived species, but rapid collapses of target stocks are unlikely due to spatial redistribution of effort in response to local declines. We question whether quota management (individual vessel quotas) can be safely implemented due to extreme uncertainty about current stock sizes and suggest that a better strategy may be to simply denominate fishing rights as individual effort quotas while providing protection for sensitive stocks through carefully placed marine protected areas.},

abstract = {We present a bioeconomic analysis of the optimal long-term management of a genetic resource in the presence of selective harvesting. It is assumed that individuals possessing a particular gene have a lower natural mortality rate and are more valuable to capture. Highly selective harvesting may cause such a gene to lose its fitness advantage, and hence change the evolutionary path of the species. Results indicate that in a zero-cost harvesting regime, the decision to preserve the valuable gene depends on the natural rate of selection against less valuable individuals and the interest rate. On the other hand, the decision to let the less valuable gene become a significant fraction of the genes depends only on biological parameters. If marginal costs are positive, it is never optimal to let a valuable gene become extinct. Further, for some parameter values, the system exhibits multiple equilibriums. Therefore, optimal regulation may depend on initial conditions. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The carrying capacity for Pacific herring (Clupea pallasi) and its relationship to primary productivity was examined for eight populations in the NE Pacific and eastern Bering Sea. Data on biomass (ages 3 and older) and catches of herring in British Columbia (Georgia Strait, west coast Vancouver Island, Central Coast, Queen Charlotte Islands, Prince Rupert) and Alaska (Sitka, Prince William Sound, eastern Bering Sea) during the second half of the 20th Century derived from analytical stock assessments were used to calculate annual surplus production of herring. There was considerable interannual variability in herring productivity among all populations, however, only three (Georgia Strait, Prince Rupert, Prince William Sound) showed significant differences in mean productivity on decadal time scales (productivity regimes). Carrying capacity for the most recent productivity regime for each population was estimated using the Schaefer surplus production model. Mean annual primary productivity was estimated from remotely-sensed (SeaWiFS) chlorophyll data for British Columbia and Sitka ecosystems, and from in situ chlorophyll data for Prince William Sound and the eastern Bering Sea. The carrying capacity for herring populations in the NE Pacific ranged from 28,000 to 250,000 tonnes, and to 325,000 tonnes in the eastern Bering Sea. When considered on the basis of their distributional area, the west coast of Vancouver Island and Georgia Strait populations had the highest carrying capacity per unit area (9.3-13.8 tonnes km-2) and the eastern Bering Sea had the lowest (0.7 tonnes km-2). There is a significant positive linear relationship between the productivity of herring populations at carrying capacity and primary productivity on a per unit area basis. Although similar direct relationships have been observed between phytoplankton standing stock (as chlorophyll biomass) and total catches of resident fish populations from these regions, such a direct relationship was unexpected between primary productivity and herring carrying capacity because of multiple trophic pathways and other factors (e.g. spawning habitat) which should limit the carrying capacity for individual populations of particular species of fish. These results may be used to forecast potential responses of herring in NE Pacific ecosystems to global changes in ocean productivity. Crown Copyright ?? 2008.},

First, a no-exploitation situation where the ecosystem performances are measured through the capacity of species richness to maintain the ecosystem above a minimum ecological viability threshold measured through a Shannon index. Second, an exploitation situation where the performances of the ecosystem are measured through its economic sustainability, that is, its capacity to generate direct-use values greater than a minimum guaranteed utility level. The analysis, based on numerical simulations, shows that biodiversity has a positive effect on both ecological and economic performances and that in both cases the marginal contribution of biodiversity is positive. Furthermore, this marginal contribution exhibits maximum values. These maximum values seem however to decrease with the level of species richness. These results show interesting links with two of the main current debates on biodiversity: the Noah's Ark problem and the assumption of decreasing marginal value supported by some recent works on bio-prospecting. {\textcopyright} 2008.},

abstract = {As pressure on the world's marine resources mounts, it is critical to understand the motivations that influence fisher behaviour to enable effective management. This study employed an ethnographic approach to interview experienced fishermen in Australia (recreational) and the Solomon Islands (subsistence/artisanal) and to provide cross-cultural insight into their behaviour, perceptions and motivations to fish. Although food and income were the most identified motivations by fishers in the Solomon Islands (100{\%} and 93{\%} of fishers, respectively), 75{\%} of motivation categories paralleled those of recreational fishers. Fishermen in the Solomon Islands also expressed an eagerness to actively pursue fishing despite the potential for alternative incomes, possibly reflecting the presence of a recreational mindset. The willingness to continue fishing in the absence of necessity illustrates the potential for growth of recreational fisheries where economic conditions improve. In Australia, connection to the environment was the most common motivation for recreational fishers (96{\%} of fishers). Recreational fishers also perceived that fishing enhanced social capital, promoted respect for nature and provided health and economic benefits. Senior fishers identified young males to be most likely to engage in excessive fishing through displays of machismo, but emphasised the role of fishing in providing a safe environment for youth to vent angst and frustration. These results suggest that fishing activities may deliver fundamental benefits to individuals and societies and that in some regions fishers may be valuable advocates for conservation and social cohesion if their motivations and values are appreciated and channelled appropriately.},

@book{VanBiervliet2005,
abstract = {The North Sea is situated between Great Britain, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, The Netherlands, Belgium and France. The Belgian North Sea coast has a total length of 65 km. This coastline plays a significant role in both regional and national economies since important industrial and service activities including fisheries, sand extraction, and tourism are located in this area. On the other hand, the Belgian sea and coast is also a unique ecological system. Such an ecological system not only provides different environmental benefits, such as the protection of valuable terrestrial and marine habitats, including sandbanks, beach, flat and salt marsh, estuary, and dune biotopes, which host a wide range of mammal and plant life diversity. For instance, vulnerable sea and coastal birds have their breeding ground and wintering place on the Belgian coast. In addition, such an ecological system is characterized by a dynamic and resilient function that, in turn, provides an important ecological services such as the chemical balance of the water. Since most of this range of environmental benefits have a price and all the industrial and service activities are market priced, human interventions have been invested in promoting these same economic activities leaving the marine and coastal ecosystem under heavier pressure. Accidental oil spills are one example of the human pressure and constitute one of the biggest threats to that ecologic system. Annually 10,000 ships sail through the English Channel heading to or coming from the ports around the North Sea, some of them with an international character, such as Rotterdam in the Netherlands and Antwerp in Belgium. Due to the shallow depth of the Southern North Sea the large ships (oil tankers among them) are channelled in a central, deep shipping route. These shipping conditions, climatic conditions, such as dense fog, and possible human errors, cause a real risk on accidents. In the period 1991-1998 eight shipping accidents occurred in the Belgian part of the North with oil spillage as a result. The largest accident, until now, in 1992 (̀Amer Fuji'/'Meritas' collision) resulted in an estimated 225m 3 oil spill. Accidents with major oil pollution happen regularly in European waters. At the end of 1999, in France, the accident with the Erika occurred in coastal waters near Bretcony. At the end of 2002, in Spain, there was the accident with the Prestige. Both accidents caused enormous damage to the marine environment. For this reason the economic valuation of the damage caused is an important instrument for environmental damage assessment (e.g. assessing who is affected by the spill and how important the damage is in monetary terms) and policy guidance (e.g. assessing which type of government intervention to implement - should one invest in prevention or restoration activities?). Following the general framework of environmental economics, we can distinguish between damages to use and non-use functions. In case of an oil spill, the most important use functions are commercial fishing and recreation activities. The data for evaluation of these functions can be respectively based on market data and alternative valuation methods such as the travel cost method1. In addition to use values, a marine and coastal ecosystem has an important non-use, existence or passive use value, which may be affected by an accidental oil spill. Existence values are defined as the benefit received from simply knowing the resource exists, even if no use is made of it. If the marine environment is affected by the disaster, e.g. the extinction of locally protected seabirds, our welfare is negatively affected. This welfare change can be estimated in monetary terms by using the Contingent Valuation (CV) method. In a CV study, a contingent valuation questionnaire is designed2. If a respondent was directly asked 'How much would you be prepared to pay for the non-operating function of the Belgian part of the North Sea?', it would be very difficult for that respondent to know what they would be paying for. That is why the non-use function of the Belgian part of the North Sea is 'translated' into something more tangible; something the respondent is more familiar with. For this reason, economists work together with natural scientists to create an oil protection scenario that is described in the instrument survey and well understood by the respondents. This method has among other things been used for the estimation of non-use values in case of the Exxon Valdez oil spill3. In the study present for discussion in this chapter, the CV method has been utilized in case of an oil spill before the Belgian Coast. {\textcopyright}2005 Springer.},

The aim of this paper is to provide some insights on this issue based on a Swedish scrapping programme for trawlers targeting cod and Norwegian lobster and the introduction of an ITQ system for pelagic vessels introduced in 2008 and 2009. Individual-level data on fishing activities and income from other industries are used to examine how effort and catches have changed after 2009, and to what extent fishermen have left the fishing industry. The lesson learnt from the Swedish case is that fishermen tend to stay in the fishing sector, and this holds true for both participants in the scrapping programme and fishermen who sold their quota in the ITQ system. Therefore measures to reduce overcapacity in targeted fleets have increased fishing pressure and competition for quotas in the Swedish small-scale fleet.},

abstract = {Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) management systems are typically introduced to promote better capital utilisation by the fishing fleet and other efficiency gains. ITQ management was introduced in the Tasmanian rock lobster industry in 1998 and led to a range of economic, social and cultural changes including an increasing proportion of the catch taken by fishers dependent on quota leasing. Quota owners who lease out their entire quota increasingly dominated ownership of the fishery. Temporal changes in lease quota trade networks and network characteristics were analysed, which showed that the lease quota trade network has become more integrated and the influence of personal connections less important. Change in the network structure of the market indicated that a smaller number of quota owners have become increasingly dominant in this market although there was no evidence that this had an effect on quota lease prices. Processors also participated in the lease quota market and influenced interactions and dependencies. In other jurisdictions processor relationships have been found to affect lease quota price developments. However, disproportionate quota ownership by processors and market manipulation did not occur here. This was due to a successful input control where quota ownership by one legal entity was capped. Because market control cannot be gained through investment in quota, another logical way of gaining it would be for processors to operate as pseudo brokers and distribute lease quota for quota owners. Although processors in Tasmania operate as pseudo brokers, the absence of structural changes in the processor market indicated that this produced no change in market power or quota owner loyalties.},

abstract = {We explored the extent to which (1) individual transferable quotas (ITQs) may lead to changes in environmental stewardship and (2) environmental stewardship may in turn contribute to explain the success or otherwise of ITQs in meeting sustainability objectives. ITQs are an example of incentive-based fisheries management in which fishing rights can be privately owned and traded. ITQs are aimed at resolving the problems created by open-access fisheries. ITQs were proposed to promote economic efficiency, and there is growing empirical evidence that ITQs meet a number of economic and social fisheries management objectives. Even though improved stock status arises as a consequence of the total allowable catch levels implemented together with ITQs, the effect is difficult to separate from the improvement attributable to existing and new management changes. However, stock status improvements have also been attributed to increased environmental stewardship resulting from the allocation of individual fishing rights. We defined environmental stewardship as a set of normative values that private individuals may hold, and that entail perceived duties and obligations to carefully manage and use marine resources. We did not debate the success or otherwise of ITQs in meeting sustainability objectives but discussed the premise that this success may in part be a consequence of a change in fishers' environmental stewardship. In particular, because of the absence of empirical literature, we explored the theoretical effects of the introduction of ITQs in conjunction with comanagement on a change in environmental stewardship. Although psychological theory suggests that there may be a relationship, there is insufficient evidence to draw the conclusion that improved environmental outcomes are attributable to changes in stewardship ethics arising from the combined effect of allocating fishing rights and comanagement in ITQ-managed fisheries...},

It presents the findings of a survey undertaken in Iceland, Greece, Spain, United Kingdom and Faroe Islands during 2008. The findings reveal differing levels of trust and mistrust in the fisheries science community between countries and between stakeholder groups, demonstrating areas for future attention in the interests of improving fisheries science and management. As this paper explores, unfortunately the "trust" necessary for effective stakeholder cooperation and participation within current fisheries science is currently somewhat lacking. The cited reasons behind this lack of trust include: a lack of soundness, credibility, responsiveness, flexibility and stakeholder involvement, flawed data and weak science, poor communications and political and lobby group interference. Notable from the results is a lack of consensus on the existence of a common language and vision. It is evident, however, that certain aspects of fisheries science are strong contributors to trust and that there are opportunities for improvement. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Health claims promise health benefits beyond basic nutrition, but their impact on food choices is largely determined by consumers' motivation and ability to process these claims. This study investigates the role of consumers' motivation and ability to process health claims as well as attitudinal and cognitive determinants in explaining the use of health claims. Data were collected in Spring 2014 through a cross-sectional quantitative online survey with samples representative for age, gender and region in 10 European countries: United Kingdom, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain, Slovenia, Czech Republic, France, Denmark, Greece, and Lithuania (n=5337). Structural equation modelling was used to simultaneously estimate the strength and direction of effects between motivation and ability to process, various determinants, and two components of health claim use. Motivation to process emerged as a key determinant of European consumers' use of health claims. Ability to process impacted claim use to a much smaller extent, but was strongly and positively influenced by the motivation to process. In order to be motivated, consumers are required to experience a need for health-related information, which in turn is driven by an interest in healthy eating. Participants with greater health claim-related knowledge tended to be more able but less motivated to process health claims. There were no substantial differences in the tested model between countries that had regulation for health claims prior to 2006 and those that did not, despite the considerable differences in their historical and current prevalence of health claims. Therefore, European food and nutrition policies and marketing strategies should focus on ways to improve consumers' motivation to process health claims by increasing their interest in healthy eating and need for health-related information.},

The objective of this article is to account for cross-national variation in this policy field. It starts by reviewing existing scholarship concerning political, institutional, and ideational determinants of ALMPs. It then argues that ALMP is too broad a category to be used without further specification, and it develops a typology of four different types of ALMPs: incentive reinforcement, employment assistance, occupation, and human capital investment. These are discussed and examined through ALMP expenditure profiles in selected countries. The article uses this typology to analyze ALMP trajectories in six Western European countries and shows that the role of this instrument changes dramatically over time. It concludes that there is little regularity in the political determinants of ALMPs. In contrast, it finds strong institutional and ideational effects, nested in the interaction between the changing economic context and existing labor-market policies.},

Macroeconomics is now firmly grounded in the principles of economic theory. We focus on the role of economic theory in shaping policy. Over the last several decades, the United States and other countries have undertaken a variety of policy changes that are precisely what macroeconomic theory of the last 30 years suggests. The evidence that theoretical advances have had a significant effect on the practice of policy is often hard to see for policymakers and advisers involved in the hurly-burly of day-to-day policymaking, but easy to see if one steps back and takes a longer-term perspective. Examples of the effects of theory on the practice of policy include increased central bank independence; adoption of inflation targeting and other rules to guide monetary policy; increased reliance on consumption and labor taxes instead of capital income taxes; and increased awareness of the costs of policies that distort labor markets.

We show that persistence of such a population of connected subpopulations depends on whether the sum of the reproductive gains through all possible closed, between-patch reproductive paths through multiple generations, relative to the shortfall in self-persistence in each path, exceeds unity plus extra terms, which only appear if there are four or more patches. These extra terms have the heuristic explanation that they avoid double counting of reproductive paths that arise with four or more patches because there can be nonoverlapping subnetworks. Thus only those patterns of reproduction and connectivity which eventually lead to descendants returning to the patch from which they originate contribute to persistence. This result provides the basis for evaluating connectivity and habitat heterogeneity to understand reserve design, the effects of human fragmentation, the collapse of marine fisheries, and other conservation issues.},

Although the sources and statistical properties of these errors differed, both of them could result in errors in stock assess- ment if estimation methods are not appropriate. Different statistical approaches used in fitting models differ in their robust- ness with respect to errors of different statistical properties in data. This study showed the importance of evaluating the qual- ity of input data and the possibility of developing an approach that is robust to errors in data.

abstract = {The study highlighted the technical efficiency of catfish production by large and small scale farms in Anambra State, Nigeria using the translog stochastic frontier production function approach. A multistage random sampling technique was used to select 256 catfish farmers for the study. However, 204 returned useful questionnaires used to collate data for analysis. Results indicated mean technical efficiency scores of 0.89 and 0.94 for the large and small scale farms respectively. This implies that the small scale farms are technically more efficient than the large scale farms, hence the large scale farms possess higher capacity (11{\%}) for expansion than the small scale farms (6{\%}). Household size and feeding method negatively and significantly influenced the inefficiency of catfish farming by large and small scale farms respectively at 5{\%} level of probability. More so, returns to scale was 1.05 at par signifying constant returns to scale for both farm groups. Technical efficiency could be increased by the minimization of use of family labour; encouraging the use of quality seeds, feeds and intensive feeding; and the adoption of improved technologies and better management practices for any of the farm groups.},

The survey shows that while a large body of theoretical work has been developed on the issue of capital adjustment in fisheries, relatively less attention has been granted to the theory of investment, where this becomes a separate decision to the decision about capital levels; i.e., where capital is quasi-malleable. In addition, empirical studies have been fairly limited, and more work is still needed to analyse and fUrther investigate these issues in practical situations. There is particularly a need for more empirical studies of investment behaviour and drivers of investment behaviour at the firm level based on adequate economic data.},

Progress has occurred in the understanding of institutional structures and the theory of fisheries governance, but analysis of EU funded research in the 6th Framework Programme (2002–2006) points to the absence of social science except in multi-disciplinary projects. The diasporic nature of fisheries social science and the absence of clearly articulated social objectives from fisheries policy are among the more plausible explanations for this unconformity. Prospects for reform of the CFP in 2012—including a redistribution of responsibilities between central and regional institutions—offer enhanced opportunities for the social sciences in interdisciplinary and specialist areas of policy related research. Responding to the challenge will necessitate the building of stronger networks within the family of social sciences and across disciplinary boundaries with the natural and economic sciences.},

Workers are assumed to be risk averse and of unknown ability or productivity. Risk neutral firms learn, as do workers, about each worker's productivity by observing the worker's output over time. It is shown that equilibrium contracts provide for wages which never decline with age and increase only when the worker's market value increases above his current wage. In addition to characterizing the equilibrium wage contract, we also derive some of its implications for the behaviour of aggregate wages across various groups of workers. These implications explain some findings in the recent empirical literature on age-earnings profiles. In particular our model can explain why earnings may be positively related to experience even after controlling for productivity, as some empirical studies have indicated.},

We introduce an analytical model with firm heterogeneity to distinguish between traditional resource rent, which accrues to all owners, and inframarginal rent, which accrues to those with high skill. We show that, in the presence of skill heterogeneity, some current users (namely those with the highest skill) may prefer common-pool management, despite large aggregate increases in rents due to rationalization. Whether the transition to property rights is Pareto improving hinges critically on the initial allocation of rights, because inframarginal rents may be lower under property rights than limited entry. In our application to an important US fishery, property rights generate a ten-fold increase in market capitalization and a doubling in the present value of the resource, but without substantial free grandfathering, the top harvesters would rationally oppose the transition to property rights.},

The success of any regulatory measure requires compliance with and acceptance of standards on the part of the regulatory bodies. This is the second proposal made by the European Commission which poses this possibility; the previous reform agreed by European Parliament in 2002 removed it due to the opposition from fishermen in some countries, among them were most of Spanish fishers. But perhaps the fishermen's preferences changed for these years. This study analyses Spanish fishermen's preferences of the possibility of introducing fishing rights, and an international comparison of fishermen's preferences is made. The results show that the industrial segments are more favourable to implement a system based on quotas, whereas the artisanal segments are more in favour of an individual effort system. The greatest similarities are obtained in Iceland and Australia, although the results achieved are based more on qualitative than quantitative analysis.},

abstract = {Charters represent an expansion of public school choice, offering free, publicly funded educational alternatives to traditional public schools. One relatively unexplored research question concerning charter schools asks whether charter schools are more efficient suppliers of educational services than are traditional public schools. The potential relative efficiency advantage of charters vis-a-vis traditional publics is one of the mechanisms that supports the hypotheses that charters could improve performance for their students while using the same or fewer resources, and that the systemic effect of charters could lead to improved outcomes for traditional public students without requiring an increase in education sector resources. In this paper, we provide evidence as to the cost efficiency of charter schools relative to traditional public schools, and explore the extent to which those differences are attributable to differences in hiring and compensation practices, or to differences in the length of time a campus has been operating. We generate estimates of efficiency using a stochastic cost frontier approach. We estimate a translog stochastic cost frontier model using panel data for charter campuses and traditional public campuses in Texas over the five-year period 2005–2009. Our main findings suggest that charter schools are able to produce educational outcomes at lower cost than traditional public schools—probably because they face fewer regulations—but are not systematically more efficient relative to their frontier than are traditional public schools.},

abstract = {Using results from annual studies in 1992-1999 in the Barents Sea, the dynamics of Northeast Atlantic minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) predation upon immature Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea harengus) are assessed. Herring spawn along the western coast of Norway, and the larvae are transported northwards to coastal areas of the southern Barents Sea where they spend their first two to four years. The abundance of immature herring year classes in the Barents Sea has been highly variable. One or a few strong year classes are usually followed by several poor year classes. In the study period, there were two particularly strong year classes (1991 and 1992). By 1996, these year classes had migrated out of the Barents Sea, and the abundance of young herring consequently decreased. In the period 1992-1999, the mean annual consumption of immature herring by minke whales in the southern Barents Sea varied considerably (640-118 000 t). The major part of the consumed herring belonged to the strong 1991 and 1992 year classes and there was a substantial reduction in the dietary importance of herring to whales after 1995, when a major part of both the 1991 and 1992 year classes migrated out of the Barents Sea. In 1992-1997, minke whales may have consumed 230 000 and 74 000 t, corresponding to 14.6 and 2.8 × 109individuals of the herring year classes of 1991 and 1992, respectively. The dietary importance of herring to whales appeared to increase in a non-linear relation with herring abundance. {\textcopyright} 2002 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {Continuously indexed Gaussian fields (GFs) are the most important ingredient in spatial statistical modelling and geostatistics. The specification through the covariance function gives an intuitive interpretation of the field properties. On the computational side, GFs are hampered with the big n problem, since the cost of factorizing dense matrices is cubic in the dimension. Although computational power today is at an all time high, this fact seems still to be a computational bottleneck in many applications. Along with GFs, there is the class of Gaussian Markov random fields (GMRFs) which are discretely indexed. The Markov property makes the precision matrix involved sparse, which enables the use of numerical algorithms for sparse matrices, that for fields in R{\^{}}2 only use the square root of the time required by general algorithms. The specification of a GMRF is through its full conditional distributions but its marginal properties are not transparent in such a parameterization. We show that, using an approximate stochastic weak solution to (linear) stochastic partial differential equations, we can, for some GFs in the Mat{\'{e}}rn class, provide an explicit link, for any triangulation of R{\^{}}2, between GFs and GMRFs, formulated as a basis function representation. The consequence is that we can take the best from the two worlds and do the modelling by using GFs but do the computations by using GMRFs. Perhaps more importantly, our approach generalizes to other covariance functions generated by SPDEs, including oscillating and non-stationary GFs, as well as GFs on manifolds. We illustrate our approach by analysing global temperature data with a non-stationary model defined on a sphere.},

Yet, there have been relatively few empirical studies of productivity changes in catch share fisheries and no comprehensive treatment of a cross-section of programs using a common measure of productivity change. In this study estimates of multi-factor productivity change for 20 catch share fisheries in the U.S. using a Lowe index are provided.

abstract = {A long-term (1907–98) virtual population analysis (VPA) was made for Norwegian spring-spawning herring (NSSH), which is a huge pelagic fish stock in the north-east Atlantic. It shows that this herring stock has had large fluctuations during the last century; these fluctuations have mainly been determined by variations in the temperature of the inflowing water masses to the region. The spawning stock biomass (SSB) increased from a rather low level in the early years of this century and reached a high level of around 14 million tons by 1930. The spawning stock biomass then decreased to a level of around 10 million tons by 1940, but increased again to a record high level of 16 million tons by 1945. The stock then started to decrease and during the next 20-year period fell to a level of less than 50 000 tons by the late 1960s. Through the 1970s and 1980s, the stock slowly recovered and after the recruitment of strong year classes in 1983 and 1990–1992 the stock recovered to a spawning stock biomass of about 10 million tons. The long-term fluctuation in spawning stock biomass is caused by variations in the survival of recruits. It is found that the long-term changes in spawning stock abundance are highly correlated with the long-term variations in the mean annual temperature of the inflowing Atlantic water masses (through the Kola section) into the north-east Atlantic region. The recruitment is positively correlated with the average temperature in the Kola section in the winter months, January–April, which indicates that environmental factors govern the large-scale fluctuations in production for this herring stock.},

A model for technique inefficiency effects in a stochastic frontier production function for panel data. Empirical Economics 20, 325-332], which incorporates the inefficiency effect, to show whether port privatization is a necessary strategy for ports to gain a competitive advantage. While this stochastic frontier model has been used to a wide number of industries where the technical inefficiency effect is required, this method has rarely been employed to port industry. This study also investigates the determinants of port competitiveness. Both the principal component analysis (PCA) and the linear regression model are used to examine the effects of identified key factors on port competitiveness. Based on a sample of selected container terminals around the world, the results of this study have shown that private sector participation in the port industry to some extent can improve port operation efficiency, which will in turn increase port competitiveness. Another important determinant of port competitiveness is the adaptability to the customers' demand. All these results provide some policy implications and guidance for port authorities and port operators in formulating effective strategies to improve their competitiveness vis-??-vis rivals. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context, the aim of this work is two-fold: firstly, to formalise a methodology for the fishing sector of a country which allows the inequality in the concentration of accidents to be analysed; and secondly, to apply this methodology to the Spanish fishing fleet for the period 1994–2002. Thus, indices are built by regions and by types of vessel for two variables: fishermen and vessels. Results are obtained both for the inequality in the concentration of accidents and their associated Lorenz curves and for the rates and elasticities of fishing sector accidents.},

Whilst there is evidence at EU level of policy convergence through the adoption of certain labour market targets, there is little evidence either of systematic learning or of significant efforts at emulation.

Some explanations for failures on the second count might be found in perceptions of major cultural and institutional differences between countries.

Comparisons must fall in an admissible range of consistency. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) includes both the rating and comparison methods.

In addition to the traditional temperature index from the Barents Sea (the average annual temperature in the Kola transect), we also developed a new index based on the temperature in the larval drift trajectories during early larval life. The models show highly significant effects of both spawning stock and temperature. The inclusion of the temperature term in the stock-recruitment models removes the autocorrelation from the residuals and improves their explanatory ability by 6-9{\%}. We explore the interdependence between recruitment success and subsequent spawning stock biomass and conclude that this is not likely to generate the stock-recruitment relationship. Our analysis suggests that the collapse of the Norwegian spring spawning herring stock in the period 1950-1970 was not caused by reduced recruitment, but by the drop in spawning stock biomass induced by the increased fisheries in this period.},

Its dominant production technology ranges from extensive to improved extensive particularly in the rural areas. This study estimates levels and determinants of farm-level technical efficiency of tilapia farmers of Bangladesh using stochastic frontier production function involving a model for technical inefficiency effects. Data from fifty tilapia farmers of Jessore district are used in the analysis. The mean technical efficiency level of the tilapia farmers is 78{\%}, and thus, the farmers operate 22{\%} below the frontier production. Inefficiency effect is significant, and age, education, income, culture length, pond age, pond depth, water colour and pond tenure, as a group, are significant determinants of technical inefficiency. By operating at full technical efficiency levels, tilapia yield can be improved from the current level of 7.36-8.96 tons per hectare. The decision to add or not to add inputs is sometimes taken arbitrarily and not based on technology requirement. There is a lack of understanding of the technology practices. Fisheries extension efforts are required for proper understanding of the technology practices, further adoption and spread. For promotion of tilapia production, quality feed and seed at affordable price needs to be ensured.},

It is often argued that Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) systems will enhance efficiency and alleviate problems of excess capacity. While improvements in efficiency have been observed, most empirical studies have found only modest changes in excess capacity as a result of such systems. Using a database of compulsory log-book information for the Tasmanian Rock Lobster Fishery in Australia, from January 2000 to December 2013, this study presents the first analysis to investigate the dynamic behaviour of both excess capacity and efficiency (i.e. technical and scale efficiency) in an industrialised fleet after the introduction of quota management. The analysis revealed weak evidence for a prolonged adjustment in the fishery following the introduction of an ITQ system. In addition, no marked changes in excess capacity were observed over the study period; and furthermore, there was no evidence for an increase in excess capacity during a period of non-binding Total Allowable Catch (TAC) when race to fish behaviour increased in the fishery. The results suggest a limited ability of the ITQ system to alleviate levels of excess capacity in fisheries in the long-term.},

We assessed food label use using both self-reported and objective measures, the stage of change, and dietary quality in a sample of 392 stratified by income. Self-reported food label use was assessed using a questionnaire. Objective use was assessed using a mock shopping task in which participants viewed food labels and decided which foods to purchase. Eye movements were monitored to assess attention to nutrition information on the food labels. Individuals paid attention to nutrition information when selecting foods to buy. Self-reported and objective measures of label use showed some overlap with each other (r=0.29, p{\textless}0.001), and both predicted dietary quality (p{\textless}0.001 for both). The stage of change diminished the predictive power of subjective (p{\textless}0.09), but not objective (p{\textless}0.01), food label use. These data show both self-reported and objective measures of food label use are positively associated with dietary quality. However, self-reported measures appear to capture a greater motivational component of food label use than do more objective measures.},

abstract = {A decision-making framework combining multi-attribute utility theory and the analytic hierarchy process is proposed to assess the performances of alternative fisheries management policies. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to a Mediterranean demersal fishery (GSA 18, Southern Adriatic Sea), for which a set of management scenarios are evaluated against their ability to cope with environmental, economic and social objectives. To this aim, (1) a suite of biological and socioeconomic indicators is identified and organized into an appropriate hierarchy; (2) a set of utility functions is defined to express the level of satisfaction associated with different values of the indicators; and (3) a set of weights, representing the relative importance of each indicator to the overall utility, is derived through a pair-wise comparison of the indicators. The proposed approach provides a practical decision-support tool to identify the management scenarios that are most desirable from the society[U+05F3]s perspective, thus providing a good compromise between the environmental, economic and social aspects of the problem. The flexible structure of the framework allows the incorporation of different management criteria and utility functions to adapt it to different decision problems.},

abstract = {The object is to specify and analyze equilibrium in a labor market with frictions when there is a significant public sector. In the vast majority of equilibrium studies on labor markets, a public sector has been ruled out by assumption. This seems a strange oversight as about 17{\%} of workers in the US are public sector workers, whereas in western Europe, approximately 22{\%} of workers work in the public sector. The goal in this study is to provide answers to such questions as: what happens to private sector wages if the public sector is increased? If the Government increases the number of public sector jobs, does this crowd out private sector jobs? When will private sector wages be greater (less) than the public sector wage? Reasonably complete answers to these questions (and others) are provided within the context of the model developed. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The relationship between reported treatments of lameness, metabolic disorders (milk fever, ketosis), digestive disorders, and technical efficiency (TE) was investigated using neutral and non-neutral stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). TE is estimated relative to the stochastic frontier production function for a sample of 574 Danish dairy herds collected in 1997. Contrary to most published results, but in line with the expected negative impact of disorders on the average cow milk production, herds reporting higher frequencies of milk fever are less technically efficient. Unexpectedly, however, the opposite results were observed for lameness, ketosis, and digestive disorders. The non-neutral stochastic frontier indicated that the opposite results are due to the relative high productivities of inputs. The productivity of the cows is also reflected by the direction of impact of herd management variables. Whereas efficient farms replace cows more frequently, enroll heifers in production at an earlier age, and have shorter calving intervals, they also report higher frequency of disorder treatments. The average estimated energy corrected milk loss per cow is 1036, 451 and 242 kg for low, medium and high efficient farms. The study demonstrates the benefit of the stochastic frontier production function involving the estimation of individual technical efficiencies to evaluate farm performance and investigate the source of inefficiency. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

These strategies have contributed to numerical stability of the local fleet at a time when most southeastern Australian fishing fleets are in decline. In effect, the Lakes Entrance fishing community has avoided, or at least delayed, outcomes that are explicitly intended by recent approaches to fisheries management. An implication of these observations is that the behavior of fishers, including, importantly, how they manage risk, offer lessons for fisheries managers with respect to both why their plans often fail and why different plans could be more successful.},

Due to perennial problems of overfishing and resource depletion, the privileged position of users are increasingly being challenged, and there have been calls for more inclusive and democratic institutions. Fish, it is argued, is a public resource and should be managed through institutional arrangements that take the public interest into account. Taking the demands for more inclusive and transparent management institutions as our starting point, the article addresses some of the issues emanating from a stakeholder approach to fisheries management. Against the backdrop of stakeholder theory, as it has been developed in the literature on business management, we attempt to identify-and classify-those with a legitimate stake in the fisheries. We also address some of the problems and complexities of stakeholder management, and conclude with a discussion of some of the central issues and challenges pertaining to the creation of more inclusive and transparent institutions in fisheries management. {\textcopyright} 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

While consolidation of school districts and expanding high school size were in vogue from the 1960s until recently, funding agencies are now sponsoring projects to reduce school size under the assumption that smaller schools will lead to higher academic achievement. There has been some scholarly work that focuses on the effects of size on achievement and recently, this literature has included district size and the competitive effects that size might generate on educational outcomes. In this paper, we focus explicitly on both district size and school size and look at a particular aspect of educational output. We argue that average daily attendance (ADA) is an output variable that is influenced by the enrollment in a school and the number of schools in a district. School attendance is critical to both achievement and dropout rates and is a directly measurable attribute of schooling. We use data from Texas schools and school districts to estimate size effects on this important policy variable.},

abstract = {• Abstract Unlike most western countries, marine fisheries in Iceland and Norway is still of some national significance. For more than two decades now, the two countries have managed their fisheries with complicated quota systems. The main rules of these two systems are explained in the article. However, the main purpose of the article is to describe how harvest rights in the two countries have been allocated since 1990. In both countries the principle of grandfathering the harvest rights has prevailed, i.e., the initial allocation has protected the professional interest of those that have already participated in the fisheries. Despite this, rules on the matter have not been engraved in stone since they have been dynamic and contingent on various amendments by the legislature and government. Basic rules on allocation have been stipulated in acts in Iceland, while in Norway they have mostly been based on regulations. Since harvest rights are transferable in Iceland, this, in principle, should make the harvest rights better protected than in Norway. However, when the matter is scrutinized, it becomes clear that the Icelandic parliament has in fact reallocated harvest rights on a recurrent basis. In Norway, rules on allocation of harvest rights have been relatively stable. This can be partly explained by the fact that the most important stakeholders in the Norwegian fisheries have in practice had important say on how the harvest rights have been allocated.},

abstract = {Sub-stock components of highly exploited migratory fish species exhibit different life-history traits and can thus show variation in productivity and vulnerability to fishing pressure. Celtic Sea herring comprises both autumn and winter-spawners that are targeted by the same fishery. The current study investigated if the relative abundances of the two components in the Celtic Sea have changed over time, and whether this could explain marked long-term trends in size-at-age. The study utilized a remarkably long time-series of biological data from commercial landings (1959-2009). Based on the maturity state of the gonads at the time of sampling, herring were assigned to seasonal spawning components. Significant temporal variations in spawning component dominance were found, even after potential bias due to fishing history patterns were accounted for. Strong directional changes in the relative proportion of spawning components consisted of autumn spawning herring proportions reaching a peak in the 1990s before drastically declining. Winter spawning herring had lower mean lengths- and weights-at-age than autumn spawning herring. The recent decline in the autumn spawning component did not fully explain the observed decline in size-at-age in the catches, with both spawning components showing similar decreases in mean-size parameters over time. Response of spawning components to environmental changes may have consequences for the fishery, especially in light of the observed influence of temperature on spawning components. Life-cycle diversity in herring stocks may confer resilience to potential climate-induced changes. Therefore, it is suggested that the relative proportions of spawning components should be monitored and diversity should be preserved as part of the management of fisheries for this species, which is characterized by stock complexity. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V..},

abstract = {In actual environmental investment for industry, the stakeholders are often required to evaluate the investment strategies according to their own subjective preferences in terms of numerical values from various criteria, such as economic eeec-tiveness, technique feasibility and environmental regulation. Thus, this situation can be regarded as a fuzzy multiple criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem, so the fuzziness and uncertainty of subjective perception should be considered. This paper proposes an alternative approach, the non-additive fuzzy integral, to cope with evaluation of fuzzy MCDM problems particularly while there is dependence among considered criteria. To illustrate the proposed procedure, the sustainable devel-opment strategy for aquatic product processors in Taiwan is investigated. In this paper we employ triangular fuzzy numbers to represent the decision makers' subjective preferences on the considered criteria, as well as for the criteria measurements to evaluate a sustainable development planning case for industry. Firstly, in this study we employ factor analysis to extract four independent common factors from those criteria. Secondly, we construct the evaluation frame using AHP composed of the above four common factors with twelve evaluated criteria, and then derive the relative weights with respect to considered criteria. Thirdly, the synthetic utility value corresponding to each sustainable development strategy is aggregated by the fuzzy weights with fuzzy performance values, and the best investment strategies can then be decided. Through this study, we suc-cessfully demonstrate that the non-additive fuzzy integral is an eeective evaluation and appears to be more appropriate than the traditional simple additive weighted method, especially when the criteria are dependent.},

Since interconnection with neigh-bouring Spain may be one of the key drivers to achieve a cost-effective low carbon pathway, combined with new generating technologies, we evaluate its importance by modelling the Portuguese system either as an isolated or as part of an integrated Iberian system. To design the low carbon roadmap for 2050 in Portugal, TIMES e The Integrated MARKAL-EFOM (MARKet ALlocation-Energy Flow Optimisation Model) System was used. It is an optimization partial equilibrium bottom-up model generator that finds the minimal cost solution for an energy system over a certain time period. Our approach accounts for the short term dynamics of supply and demand to enable a better match and optimize resources complementarities. The results show that modelling Portugal as an isolated system can lead to underinvestment and underuse of the country's endowment of renewable energy sources in the longer term, which reduces the efficiency of investment. The modelling of Portugal as an interconnected energy system can therefore have a significant impact on the design of a sustainable electricity system and lead to improved in-vestment efficiency with lower costs risk.},

Here, we continue the discussion initiated by Newman and Dale (2005), which highlighted the fact that not all social networks are created equal. We discuss the relation between some structural characteristics and functions of social networks with respect to natural resource management, thus focusing on structural implications that are often overlooked when studying social networks within the context of natural resource management. We present several network measures used to quantify structural characteristics of social networks and link them to a number of features such as learning, leadership, and trust, which are identified as important in natural resource management. We show schematically that there may be inherent juxtapositions among different structural characteristics that need to be balanced in what we envision as social network structures conducive to adaptive co-management of natural resources. We argue that it is essential to develop an understanding of the effects that different structural characteristics of social networks have on natural resource management.},

abstract = {Small-scale fisheries have traditionally received less research effort than large-scale fisheries and are generally under-studied in Europe. In spite of their comparatively low volume of catches and economic importance, small-scale fisheries are socially important and an integral part of the European coastal zone. Considering the high heterogeneity of situations and the paucity of quantitative data, we used an analytical methodology based on the comparative method. We carried out an analysis of small-scale fisheries (SSFs) in Europe based on a selection of nine case studies. Our objective was to obtain a comprehensive description of small-scale fleets covering different areas/fisheries/species, encompassing the diversity and specific conditions under which SSFs operate, in order to demonstrate the ecological and social sustainability of this often overlooked fisheries segment. A common approach formulated so that the case studies could be compared with the case histories of other competing users, required that for each set of criteria - technical, biological, socio-economic, and institutional - a set of relevant items and indicators was established. An analysis of characteristics common to the selected case studies is conducted and an attempt made to extend our comparisons to the whole of the European Union. Our results show that (as compared with large-scale fleets, their main competitor) small-scale fleets: (i) are composed of smaller vessels and, consequently, travel lower distances to fishing grounds, and are more reliant on coastal areas; (ii) have smaller crews (although the global employment figure is similar to that of large-scale fleets in Europe); (iii) use mostly, but not exclusively, passive gears; (iv) use multi-purpose fishing approaches, and can change the fish species they target during the year; (v) have lower extraction rates; (vi) have lower total capital investments (including fishing rights), turnover and costs; and (vii) have lower fuel consumption, making them less sensitive to changing oil prices. Dependence on subsidies is lower (viii). Involvement in fisheries management is variable, conservation and access regulation measures are largely local in origin. For the selected case studies, the most significant competitors are large-scale fleets, and recreational fisheries, but other sources of interaction (water quality, invasive species, etc.) cannot be ignored. {\textcopyright}2012 Elsevier B.V.},

In particular, coho abundance trends increased during the period of extremely low herring biomass in the late 1960s and early 1970s. In contrast, coho abundance was low during the period of high herring biomass in the 1990s. A change in the ocean environment in the 1990s increased coho marine mortality, possibly due to reduced growth rates of coho during their first marine summer. Juvenile herring and juvenile coho consume some similar prey, Thus, it is possible that when the ocean environment changed in the 1990s, the marine carrying capacity for coho was reduced, and herring affected coho survival by competing for similar prey.},

abstract = {Understanding the behaviour of fishermen is a key ingredient to successful fisheries management. The aggregate behaviour of fishing fleets can be predicted and managed with appropriate incentives. To determine appropriate incentives, we should look to successes to learn what works and what does not. In different fisheries incentive systems have been found to reduce the race-for-fish and make fisheries profitable, to stimulate stock rebuilding, to reduce bycatch, and to provide for reductions in illegal fishing. Yet, success can be evaluated in many dimensions, but is, in fact, rarely done – per cent overfished seems to be the dominant measure of performance. I evaluate the yield lost due to overfishing in several ecosystems and contrast the situation of North Atlantic cod where considerable yield is lost, to fisheries in New Zealand and the west coast of the USA where lost yield due to overfishing is very small. Much more systematic evaluation of the other aspects of fisheries performance is greatly needed. From examples explored in this paper I conclude that prevention of overfishing can be achieved with strong central governments enforcing conservative catch regulations, but economic success appears to require an appropriate incentive structure.

The as- sessment model is age- and sex-structured, takes account of gear selectivity and explicitly considers the peculiarities of the pupping process. Catch, catch-rate, length-frequency, age-composition and tagging data are used within a maximum-likelihood estimation framework to estimate the free parameters of the model. The current pup production is estimated to be in excess of conventional target and limit levels. The relationship between fishing effort and fishing mortality is estimated to saturate at high levels of fishing effort. The availability of gummy sharks to fishers is estimated to be non-uniform. The use of length- and age-composition data allow estimation of year-class strength and also the potential to provide support for more complicated model structures. In this case, the support for the hypothesis that availability is not the same for all gummy sharks rests on evidence in the length-frequency data. Whether any one data source may be providing misleading impressions regarding population trends can be examined only if the assessment includes several data sources. In the case of gummy shark in Bass Strait, estimates of productivity and natural mortality are sensitive to whether the tagging or length-frequency data are included in the assessment.},

Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-{\$}\alpha{\$}-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA}for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},

abstract = {The Icelandic aerial survey component of the T-NASS project is a continuation of a series of surveys covering Icelandic shelf waters, using nearly identical design and methodology, conducted in 1987, 1995 and 2001. The primary target species is the common minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata) with humpback whales (Megaptera novaeangliae) and harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) as secondary targets. Cue counting methods are used for baleen whales while standard line transect procedures are used for other species. The latest survey was conducted in June – July 2007 and achieved 79{\%} of planned coverage under acceptable conditions. A total of 431 unique sightings were made, including 70 groups of minke whales, 119 of harbour porpoises, 58 of humpback whales and 109 of white-beaked dolphins (Lagenorhynchus acutus). The general distribution pattern of most species was similar to that seen in previous surveys, with some exceptions. Minke whales occurred in lower numbers and were absent from some nearshore areas where they were abundant in previous surveys. The abundance estimate for minke whales using unique sightings from all observers and standard cue counting methods is 10,680 (95{\%} CI 5,873, 17,121), only 24{\%} of the estimate from 2001, a significant decrease. This decrease is almost certainly not an artefact of changes in survey methods. Several factors that may have contributed to the apparent decrease are presented but the proximate cause remains uncertain. Harbour porpoises sightings were made in all nearshore blocks in much higher numbers than previously seen: this is probably primarily because an experienced harbour porpoise observer was employed on the survey. Humpback whales were absent from eastern Iceland where they have been abundant previously, but this may have been the result of gaps in coverage. Recommendations to improve future surveys in the area are presented.},

abstract = {Technical efficiency, uncertainties in data quality and natural fluctuations in fishing stocks constitute potential sources of fishing vessel inefficiency. Moreover, debate is on-going as to whether the skill of the fishermen (“skipper effect”) is an underlying actor in fishing efficiency. Therefore, this article monitors, calculates and quantifies the inefficiency caused by the “skipper effect”, if any, through the use of data envelopment analysis (DEA), with the aim of determining whether best practice target operational values in DEA, and their associated environmental impact reductions through LCA+DEA methodology, are achievable beyond the theoretical baseline they involve. A window analysis model is applied to the US menhaden fishery, a purse seining fleet with high homogeneity, since it is owned by the same company, with similar vessel and management characteristics. Results revealed relevant inefficiency levels in the four ports assessed, suggesting the existence of a “skipper effect” in all of them. Strong variances between vessels were identified, not only on an annual mean basis, but also per week of study. These variances could be attributed to random variation through time, if it were not for the fact that best performing vessels managed to repeatedly perform at high efficiency rates throughout the period. Moreover, standard deviations of low efficiency vessels were higher in all ports. Consequently, best performing targets calculated in LCA+DEA may be difficult to achieve in fleets where skipper skill strongly influences the sources of inefficiency. In these cases, the results suggest that resource minimization should be linked to specific measures to improve the individual skills of low performing vessels to attain best practice targets.},

This management system was introduced relatively recently (mid-1990s). Given the importance of fishing to the Faroe economy and culture, considerable interest has been ex-pressed in the evaluation of these new management measures at the ecosystem level. We used Ecopath with Ecosim to examine alternative management options for the Faroe Islands fisheries and compared these options with the status quo. Spatially explicit simulations were carried out using the Ecospace routine. Simulations suggest that current area closures could be considered beneficial in conserving major stocks of demersal species, with biomass for cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus) and other demersal species increasing over the 10-year simulation period. Simulated removal of the closure sys-tem reduced the effect of the projected stock increases considerably. Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides), one of the major deep-water species, and blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou), one of the main pelagic species, did not benefit from the existing spatial management. Simulated additional offshore closures of at least 20{\%} of habitats deeper than 200 m benefited Greenland halibut only. Both, Greenland halibut and blue whiting stocks benefited from drastic reductions in fish-ing effort (between 20 and 50{\%} reductions from 1997 effort levels). Considerable uncertainty underlies the basic input data, which might have major consequences for the dynamic behaviour of the simulations, and thus might significantly alter the outcomes.},

Our simulation study involved adding known amounts of measurement error to error-free catch and effort data to determine the effects of using such estimates of catch and effort rather than the true, and in many cases unknown, quantities. Our results suggest that naive estimation using estimates of catch and effort as true values may bias estimates of population size and the catchability coefficient. In most cases, the effects of measurement error in catch and effort were to inflate the parameter estimates, the magnitude of inflation being dependent on the size of the measurement error variance. Maximum likelihood estimation proved to be the estimation procedure most robust to the errors in measurement, but still displayed the need for correction of the measurement-error-induced bias.

abstract = {The impact of ocean acidification on fisheries is a relatively new issue facing decision-makers, and one for which very little empirical data is available to draw upon. This paper demonstrates how, despite the lack of knowledge, well-established methods of bioeconomic modelling and decision analysis can be applied to address the challenge. A decision support framework is developed, incorporating a dynamic age-structured bioeconomic model together with a set of decision tables applicable in the absence of known probabilities of future change. With such a model it is possible to trace ocean acidification as an additional stressor, specifically on fisheries targeting calcifier species, such as many high value mollusks. We do so by shifting growth and natural mortality parameters into time varying functions of ocean acidity (pH), as forecasted by climate scenarios reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Possible effects of ocean acidification on calcifier species with various life cycles were modeled beginning with initial biological parameters of the growth and mortality dynamic functions reflecting differences in individual growth, natural mortality and species longevity. The analysis illustrates how fishery outcomes depend on the extent of ocean acidification and the life cycle of calcifier species. Results also indicate that under uncertainty, there is value in taking precautionary management measures, such as reducing fishing intensity.},

abstract = {The oceans provide food, employment and income for billions of people. We analyzed data from scientific stock assessments, and from a statistical model for other fish stocks, to summarize the past and present status, and the potential catch, abundance and profit for 4713 fish stocks constituting 78{\%} of global fisheries. Three major scenarios of future trends are considered; business as usual (BAU) in which largely unmanaged fisheries move towards bioeconomic equilibrium but where well-managed fisheries maintain their management, maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in which fisheries are managed to maximize yield, and fisheries reform (REF) where the competitive race to fish is eliminated and fisheries are managed to maximize profit. The future prospects differ greatly based on region of the world and product type. This analysis forecasts that yield in major tuna and forage fish species will remain roughly the same as current levels under all three scenarios, while there does appear to be potential for increased yield of whitefish. There is considerable room for increased profit in most of these fisheries from better management. Increased yield will come from rebuilding overexploited stocks, reducing fishing mortality on stocks that are still abundant but fished at high rates, and surprisingly from fishing some stocks harder. Indeed in Europe and North America the primary potential for increased yield comes from fully exploiting stocks that are now lightly exploited. Asia provides the greatest opportunity for increased fish abundance and increased profit by fisheries reform that would lead to reduced fishing pressure.},

These objectives typically include economic, biological and social goals such as improving the income of fishers, reducing the catch of depleted species and maintaining employment. Multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) techniques appear well-suited to such a man-agement problem, allowing compromises between conflicting objectives to be analysed in a structured framework. In comparison to other fields, such as water resource planning, forestry and agriculture, there have been few applications of MCDM to fisheries. In this paper, a goal programming model of the North Sea demersal fishery is presented. The model is used to demonstrate the potential applicability of this type of approach to the analysis and development of fisheries management plans with multiple objectives. Alterna-tive scenarios are considered for the problem, and trade-offs between given objectives are also highlighted and discussed.},

This paper applies a multi-criteria analysis approach to quantify stakeholder groups' priorities for seawater desalination plants that have been proposed in communities adjacent to a National Marine Sanctuary. All groups placed the highest importance on minimizing environmental impacts on protected areas and endangered species that could be affected by water intake and brine discharge emphasizing the need for integrated land and sea conservation. Minimizing socio-economic impacts on coastal communities was much less important. Stakeholders also weighted reducing pressure on water levels in rivers, streams, and aquifers as more important than increasing water for residential consumption, which may foster coastal growth rather than replacing water taken from other sources. The study further revealed differences in the importance of multiple management objectives among stakeholder groups, which highlights the need to elicit distinct priorities of all groups to understand concerns and potential conflicts of desalination with existing marine users. The analysis of consistency ratios revealed that around half of all surveyed stakeholders had high inconsistencies in their responses, which suggests either a lack of understanding of desalination, or reflects the complexity of establishing desalination plants in coastal areas adjacent to a marine protected area.},

It is shown that growth parameters estimated from these two types of data have different meanings and thus are not directly comparable. In particular, the von Bertalanffy parameter B, means asymptotic mean length at age for age-length data, and maximum length for tagging data, when estimated by conventional methods. New parameterinations are given for the von Bertalanffy equation which avoid this ambiguity and better represent the growth information in the two types of data. The comparison between growth estimates from these data sets is shown to be equivalent to comparing the mean growth rate of fish of a given age with that of fish of length equal to the mean length at that age. How much these growth rates may differ in real populations remains unresolved: estimates for two species of fish produced markedly different results, neither of which could be reproduced using growth models. Existing growth models are shown to be inadequate to answer this question. Les},

Fisheries policy in Iceland is, consequently, of national importance to a degree that is not comparable to any of the EU member states. Demersal fish species (including cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), redfish (Sebastes spp.) and Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides)), flatfish and shellfish constitute almost 80{\%} of the value of landings even though around 70{\%} of the total volume of landings is constituted by pelagic species. Cod, which is mainly caught in the Icelanders' own exclusive economic zone, is the economically most important fish. The aim of this chapter is to evaluate the Icelandic individual transferable quota shares system with its management innovations, e.g. harvest control rule for cod, cod equivalents, temporary closed areas, community quotas and features for regulation of quota concentration. The evaluation considers four possible fisheries management objectives, namely biological robustness, cost-effectiveness of management, economic efficiency, and social robustness. In order to make this evaluation, a thorough understanding of the past and present situation on Iceland has to be established. The chapter is based on two sources of information: desk studies and a field study trip.},

abstract = {This paper develops and structurally estimates a labor market model that integrates job assignment, learning, and human capital acquisition to account for the main patterns of ca-reers in firms. A key innovation is that the model incorporates workers' job mobility within and between firms, and the possibility that, through job assignment, firms affect the rate at which they acquire information about workers. The model is estimated using longitudinal administrative data on managers from one U.S. firm in a service industry (the data of Baker, Gibbs, and Holmstr{\"{o}}m (1994a,b)) and fits the data remarkably well. The estimated model is used to assess both the direct effect of learning on wages and its indirect effect through its impact on the dynamics of job assignment. Consistent with the evidence in the literature on comparative advantage and learning, the estimated direct effect of learning on wages is found to be small. Unlike in previous work, by jointly estimating the dynamics of beliefs, jobs, and wages imposing all of the model restrictions, the impact of learning on job assignment can be uncovered and the indirect effect of learning on wages explicitly assessed. The key finding of the paper is that the indirect effect of learning on wages is substantial: overall learning accounts for one quarter of the cumulative wage growth on the job during the first seven years of tenure. Nearly all of the remaining growth is from human capital acquisition. A related novel finding is that the different speed of learning at different jobs is a primary determinant of the timing of promotions and wage increases. Along with persistent uncertainty about ability, these differences in the speed of learning across jobs are responsible for substantially compressing wage growth in low tenures.},

@book{Hart2008,
abstract = {Recent decades have witnessed strong declines in fish stocks around the globe, amid growing concerns about the impact of fisheries on marine and freshwater biodiversity. Fisheries biologists and managers are therefore increasingly asking about aspects of ecology, behaviour, evolution and biodiversity that were traditionally studied by people working in very separate fields. This has highlighted the need to work more closely together, in order to help ensure future success both in management and conservation. The Handbook of Fish Biology and Fisheries has been written by an international team of scientists and practitioners, to provide an overview of the biology of freshwater and marine fish species together with the science that supports fisheries management and conservation. This volume, subtitled Fish Biology, reviews a broad variety of topics from evolutionary relationships and global biogeography to physiology, recruitment, life histories, genetics, foraging behaviour, reproductive behaviour and community ecology. The second volume, subtitled Fisheries, uses much of this information in a wide-ranging review of fisheries biology, including methods of capture, marketing, economics, stock assessment, forecasting, ecosystem impacts and conservation. Together, these books present the state of the art in our understanding of fish biology and fisheries and will serve as valuable references for undergraduates and graduates looking for a comprehensive source on a wide variety of topics in fisheries science. They will also be useful to researchers who need up-to-date reviews of topics that impinge on their fields, and decision makers who need to appreciate the scientific background for management and conservation of aquatic ecosystems.

Alternatively to order volume II, go to: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=063206482X or to order the 2 volume set, go to: http://www.blackwellpublishing.com/book.asp?ref=0632064838. Provides a unique overview of the study of fish biology and ecology, and the assessment and management of fish populations and ecosystems. The first volume concentrates on aspects of fish biology and ecology, both at the individual and population levels, whilst the second volume addresses the assessment and management of fish populations and ecosystems. Written by an international team of expert scientists and practitioners. An invaluable reference tool for both students, researchers and practitioners working in the fields of fish biology and fisheries.},

@article{Galland2018,
abstract = {Fisheries management is a difficult process that requires policymakers and scientists to work in concert with one another to set quotas or other management actions that conserve fisheries resources for long-term use. Policymakers take such actions based on advice from their scientists, who serve as independent knowledge providers. There are many examples, however, of policymakers allowing short-term financial or political objectives to drive their decision making rather than strictly adhering to the advice of their scientists. Throughout the histories of the International Commission for Conservation of Atlantic Tunas and the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, policymakers have followed the advice of their scientists only 39{\%} and 17{\%} of the time, respectively. There are also a number of cases where a lack of clarity in the scientific advice leads to undesirable management actions, either a result of simple misinterpretation by policymakers or imprecision in the advice allowing for a range of actions not intended by the scientists. To improve the likelihood that managers and scientists interpret language in the same way, it is important that scientists provide advice that is explicit and precise and clearly states the appropriate management measures to be applied. Here, a set of guidelines that may help scientists to achieve the necessary clarity is presented. Following these steps would allow scientists to clearly describe stock assessment results and other complex scientific processes and provide their expert advice in a manner that is most useful for policymakers but without sacrificing their reputation of independent knowledge provision.},

This is because, in a global dataset spanning 121 countries over the past four decades, changes in the share of income of the poorest quintiles are uncorrelated with changes in average income. The variation in changes in quintile shares is also small relative to the variation in growth in average incomes, implying that the latter accounts for most of the variation in income growth in the poorest quintiles. In addition, we find little evidence that changes in the bottom quintile shares are correlated with country-level factors that are typically considered as important determinants for growth in average incomes or for changes in inequality. This evidence confirms the central importance of economic growth for improvements in living standards at the low end of the income distribution. It also illustrates the difficulty of identifying specific macroeconomic policies that are significantly associated with the growth rates of those in the poorest quintiles relative to everyone else.},

The potential capacity output is calculated using an output-orientated measure. CU is assessed using both a partial CU measure, which permits CU to be assessed relative to each output, and a ray measure. Based on the ray measure, the average CU for the Danish Gill-net fleet was estimated to be between 0.85 and 0.95. The partial CU measure for cod was determined to be approximately the same as the overall or ray CU measure, but the partial CU measure for plaice was less than the level of the ray measure, which indicated that the production of plaice could be increased by a higher proportion than could the production of cod. The optimal variable input utilization was also estimated. It was determined that, on average, the variable input - number of trips - could be increased by 27{\%} compared to the optimal level. Results also indicated higher excess capacity for cod and sole than for other species, which is in accordance with how the fishery developed. ?? 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

The ocean and the freshwater ecosystems of the world make significant contributions to people's well-being via the many vital social and environmental services they provide (for example, food and nutrition, employment and incomes, carbon cycling and sequestration). The impact that the increase in fishing since the 1950s has had on wild fish stocks, and the significant increase in aquaculture production in the 20th century, have resulted in severe environmental impacts. This has significant effects on marine ecosystems and the health of oceans. The erosion of the resource undermines communities' long-term interests, including food security, employment, and income. Attempts by the global community to address challenges of sustainable production by improving the governance and management of fisheries resources range from national management of fisheries resources, to regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) for international fisheries stocks.

abstract = {Environmental risk assessment and decision-making strategies over the last several decades have become increasingly more sophisticated, information-intensive, and complex, including such approaches as expert judgment, cost – benefit analysis, and toxicological risk assessment. One tool that has been used to support environmental decision-making is comparative risk assessment (CRA), but CRA lacks a structured method for arriving at an optimal project alternative. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) provides better-supported techniques for the comparison of project alternatives based on decision matrices, and it also provides structured methods for the incorporation of project stakeholders' opinions i n the ranking of alternatives. We argue that the inherent uncertainty in our ability to predict ecosystem evolution and response to different management policies requires shifting from optimization-based management to an adaptive management paradigm. This paper brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe and synthesizes state-of- the-art research in CRA, MCDA, and adaptive management methods applicable to environmental remediation and restoration projects. We propose a basic decision analytic framework that couples MCDA with adaptive management and its public participation and stakeholder value elicitation methods, and we demonstrate application of the framework to a realistic case study based on contaminated sediment management issues in the New York/New Jersey Harbor.},

This paper applies an existing framework for assessing equity in resource use systems to tradable quota systems in fisheries. The framework defines the perspectives of distributive fairness, the stakeholders who are bound by fair practice rules, and instruments of fairness, and identifies metrics to assess equity in practice. We assess if the framework provides practical guidance for evaluating whether a given ITQ system operates under an equitable framework programme.},

The maxlmum-likelihood method is applied for the estimation of the parameters of the model and the prediction of the technical efficiencies of the firms over time. The generalized likelihood-ratio test is considered for testing the null hypotheses, that the inefficiency effects are not stochastic or that they do not depend on the firm-speciflc variables. An empirical application of the inefficiency stochastic frontier model is obtained using up to ten years of data on paddy farmers from an Indian village.},

abstract = {Gadget is a statistical modelling framework which can be used to create multispecies, multifleet, multiarea models. The development of a complex multispecies model requires understanding of the modelled single species population. Simple single species models also are essential in evaluating whether more complex models increase understanding of the population dynamics. In this paper, Gadget is illustrated using a single species case study with two stock components on one area. Features of the implementation include immature and mature stock components, maturation, preda-tion of the immature stock component and two fleets. Parameter estimation is done using maximum likelihood based on a variety of datasets. The estimated parameters relate to growth, maturation, fleet selection, recruitment, the initial population and consumption. Likelihood data include survey indices, biological samples from the catch and survey and stomach data. Optimisation of the model, along with a protocol to estimate appropriate weighting of the likelihood components are described. The effect of reduced data availability on parameter estimation is also considered, both by ag-gregating the likelihood component data (eg using coarser length categories) and by excluding age data from the likelihood components.},

abstract = {The overfishing of an increasing number of fish populations has put focus on the need for development of robust sustainable harvest strategies that can be easily implemented. This requires estimates and modelling of the deterministic and stochastic components of the population dynamics as well as an evaluation of the contribution of different harvest strategies to future population fluctuations. Here we present an example of such an approach, using the collapse of Norwegian spring-spawning herring stock as a case. We demonstrate that the collapse probably was due to overfishing, and that the large influence of the environmental stochasticity could only influence the timing of the collapse. We suggest that a proportional threshold strategy with a threshold around 14 billion individuals (4 200 000 tons), combined with a harvest of 30-40{\%} of the individuals above this threshold will give a sustainable yield with little annual variation. The choice of harvest strategy should also be strongly influenced by the uncertainty in the assessment of stock size. When the population stock is estimated with uncertainty, the proportional threshold strategy give a mean annual yield close to the optimum for known population size.},

During this period, the production has on average been growing with 8{\%} per year. At the same time, the price of salmon has stabilized indicating that an increase in demand is driving the production growth rather than increasing productivity in the sector.A Malmquist index approach is used to calculate total factor productivity change applying data envelopment analysis to construct the underlying production frontier. Furthermore, the bootstrap approach has been applied to construct confidence intervals for the Malmquist change indices. The results show a total factor productivity change of 1-2{\%} a year, where the contribution from technical efficiency change is between 0.2 and 1.2{\%} and technological change is between 0.6 and 0.8{\%}.The results show that productivity growth has slowed down over the years indicating that demand growth is the main driver of production growth. Furthermore, as productivity growth is slowing down production growth can only happen when the production area is increased. The scarcity of suitable production sites can potentially be the most limiting factor to future production growth in the salmon aquaculture industry. ?? 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

The uncertainty associated with survey estimates is therefore an important element in the evaluation of population estimates from SPA. In this paper, we compare three methods of assessing the accuracy of estimates of projected catch from SPA where survey abundance estimates alone were used in a nonlinear least-squares calibration (ADAPT). The first two methods are forms of 'bootstrap' resampling where either the actual survey data is resampled or random numbers from a statistical distribution are 'sampled' to form new estimates of abundance from the survey. The third is a linear approximation method for nonlinear least-squares. All of the methods show to the same degree that the estimates of projected catch can be biased. This bias has to be taken into account when calculating the other measures of accuracy such as confidence intervals},

Available tools originate from a variety of disciplines and are as diverse as the risks they address, including algorithms to aid in making decisions with multiple stakeholders, reserves to buffer against economic or biological surprises, and insurance instruments to help fishermen cope with economic variability. Techniques are organized in a two-stage framework. In the first stage, risks are identified and analysed. Strategies presented in this category focus on decision analysis, including multicriteria decision-making tools, and the related concept of risk assessment. Then in the treatment stage, identified risks can be transferred, avoided, or retained using tools such as the Precautionary Approach, portfolio management, financial contracts to manage price risk and horizontal integration. Published fishery applications are reviewed, and some empirical examples of risks and risk management using US fisheries data are presented.},

abstract = {Decision-making in environmental projects requires consideration of trade-offs between socio-political, environmental, and economic impacts and is often complicated by various stakeholder views. Multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) emerged as a formal methodology to face available technical information and stakeholder values to support decisions in many fi elds and can be especially valuable in environmental decision making. This study reviews environmental applications of MCDA. Over 300 papers published between 2000 and 2009 reporting MCDA applications in the environmental fi eld were identi fi ed through a series of queries in the Web of Science database. The papers were classi fi ed by their environmental application area, decision or intervention type. In addition, the papers were also classi fi ed by the MCDA methods used in the analysis (analytic hierarchy process, multi-attribute utility theory, and outranking). The results suggest that there is a signi fi cant growth in environmental applications of MCDA over the last decade across all environmental application areas. Multiple MCDA tools have been successfully used for environmental applications. Even though the use of the speci fi c methods and tools varies in different application areas and geographic regions, our review of a few papers where several methods were used in parallel with the same problem indicates that recommended course of action does not vary signi fi cantly with the method applied.},

abstract = {In Norway there is a long tradition of allocating fish resources among the fishers. In modern times this has been done through specific allocation keys. This article describes the development of the allocation system for the offshore (trawler) and coastal fleets. The allocation system is closely related to stock assessment and the fixing of global quotas (TACs) as well as structural policies to prevent “capacity creep”. All three systems can be seen as institutions, where the TAC-machine is firmly established while the two others are under pressure, largely due to competition on the global fish market. The established goal of maintaining a diversified fishing fleet is now gradually being dismantled, with repercussions for coastal employment and settlement patterns. The coastal fleet is per 2013 something entirely different from the situation in 1990, when the coastal fisheries were effectively closed. Sooner or later this development is bound to change also the management institutions, and in particular the allocation system and the closely related structural policies.},

In the 33 cases selected, they mainly used literature to build the criteria and AHP or Fuzzy AHP to calculate their weight, while other techniques were used to evaluate alternatives.},

abstract = {The marine ecosystems off Labrador and Newfoundland, east and west Greenland, Iceland and that of the Barents Sea will be termed Arcto-boreal systems in the following. In terms of environmental conditions, these ecosystems are characterized by large annual and seasonal fluctuations, in physical parameters such as temperature and nutrients, as well as in biological conditions such as primary and secondary production. Such fluctuations may give rise to biological variability in higher trophic levels in recruitment, growth rates, stock sizes and yields. Typically, such an Arcto-boreal system includes Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua, Gadidae) as a major fish predator with capelin (Mallotus villosus, Osmeridae) and shrimp (Pandalus borealis) as its main prey. Also typically, several components of the ecosystems are harvested, including both prey and predator species. Apex predators include several whale and seal species as well as seabirds, and in some cases it may be important to take these into account. When considering the economics of a harvesting strategy, it is important to consider the ecosystem components which clearly affect the relevant stocks, and thus factors such as the capelin and the shrimp, and eventually marine mammals, clearly need to be considered when the fishery for cod is under consideration. In the following, a conceptual model of the dynamics of an Arcto-boreal system will be described. Because some important multispecies interactions are clearly inherent in the system, this will be a multispecies model.},

Second, the standard production risk model is extended to accommodate technical inefficiency and producers' attitude toward risk. Finally, the technical efficiency model is generalized to accommodate production risk and producers' attitude toward risk.

The reduction depends on the number of species, the catch-frequency distributions of individual species, and the level of co-occurrence of species in the catch. We explore theoretically the reduction of variability (coefficient of variation; CV) in the total catch by combining the distributions of daily catches of individual fish species, including zero catches, into a total catch frequency distribution. Theoretical findings are tested with an example from a stationary lift-net fishery for schooling small pelagic species around Ambon Island in the Central Moluccas, Indonesia. This fishery catches over 30 species, all with high daily variability (CV = 2.2–13.4). The reduction of variability in the total catch (CV = 1.7) is a result of the dominance and independent occurrence of the three main species. We conclude that in this fishery the information value of the total catch as an indicator of the catches of the individual ...},

abstract = {Many policymakers attribute the success of fisheries management regimes to the design and implementation of particular regulatory tools. While sound design and effective implementation are crucial elements of any successful regulatory action, fisheries policymakers and regulators should also account for the heterogeneous sociocultural institutions of partner communities. The success of fisheries policies relies on compliance and, ideally, cooperation (accepting policies, i.e. not protesting or otherwise strongly agitating against the system) from fisheries stakeholders. Even a policy that is sound in design and flawless in execution is at risk of failure if target stakeholders obstruct or otherwise undermine the system. This paper investigates how institutions, at various levels of scale and formality, play a role in determining the degree of compliance and/or cooperation that a fisheries management regime enjoys. In particular, it will examine the issue of Individual Vessel Quotas (IVQs) in Norway, and the response of fishing communities to the trade liberalization of IVQs.},

@book{LeGrand2002,
abstract = {Offering a new answer to an age-old problem: the meaning of a just or equitable distribution of resources, Julian Le Grand examines the principal interpretations of equity used by economists and political philosophers. He argues that none captures the essence of the term as well as an alternative conception relating equity to the existence or otherwise of individual choice. Le Grand shows that this conception is not only philosophically well-grounded but is also directly relevant to key areas of distributional policy. His theoretical argument is complemented by detailed discussion of the application of the central idea to specific areas of policy, including the distribution of health and health care, central government grants to local governments and the measurement of income for tax purposes. Equity and Choice is written by an economist, but is intended for political philosophers and social policy analysts as well as economists. Hence the key chapters are written in a non-technical fashion, with specialized material relegated to appendices. This book is a unique combination of philosophical, economic and policy analysis and represents a major contribution in all three areas.},

For the latter two species the trends estimated were similar. The predation mortality, M2, was quite different for the two models with a higher inter annual variation in M2 for the MSVPA. The precision of SSB and average F are determined almost entirely by the quality of catch and survey observations and not by the stomach contents observations.

It is pertinent to ask now: has this potential been realized, and in what forms? This paper highlights progress in the field over the past three decades. We begin our review with the early two-player dynamic game-theoretic analyses. Next, we illustrate how coalition theory has been brought in over the past decade to allow the modeling of games with greater than two players, and how coalitional externalities, a major issue in international and shared fish stocks management, have been incorporated recently. Finally, we highlight new areas for game theory to come into its own in fisheries, which will most definitely include the potential for catch rights in international shared-stock fisheries, as well as ecosystem dynamics to be modeled in a game-theoretic context. As game theory can offer insights into the challenges of achieving cooperative fisheries management, we hope the next decade of fisheries economics research will include a bigger leap from academic game theory exercises to impacting policy decisions. ?? 2009 Elsevier B.V.

Using data on population status, quota compliance, discard rates, use of habitat-damaging gear, and landings for 15 catch share programs in North America, I tested the hypothesis that catch share systems lead to improved ecological stewardship and status of exploited populations. Impacts of catch share programs were measured through comparisons of fisheries with catch shares to fisheries without catch shares or by comparing fisheries before and after catch shares were implemented. The average levels of most indicators were unaffected by catch share implementation: only discard rate, which declined significantly in catch share fisheries, showed a significant response. However, catch share fisheries were distinguished by markedly reduced interannual variability in all indicators, being statistically significant for exploitation rate, landings, discard rate, and the ratio of catch to catch quotas. These impacts of catch shares were common between nations and ocean basins and were independent of the number of years that catch share programs had been in place. These findings suggest that for the indicators examined, the primary effect of catch shares was greater consistency over time. This enhanced consistency could be beneficial to fishery systems and might also be an indication of more effective management.},

Although the two trends may not be related, distinguishing among the factors responsible requires a better understanding of minke whale habitat preferences. For the first time at a large geographic scale, i.e., between 140° E and 35° W, we use data not constrained by vessels needing to avoid sea ice to model the habitat affinities of this pagophilic mesopredator. Using Maxent, we modeled minke whale proximity to the Antarctic Shelf Break Front (ASBF) and the southern boundary of Antarctic Circumpolar Current (sbACC), as well as association with sea ice, given that global climate change is altering the positions or intensity of these features. We also included water depth and chlorophyll (proxy for productivity) as variables. Minke whale presence data were gathered using strip and line census on 55 cruises on board icebreakers during late spring and summer, 1976–2005. The most important variable was distance to ASBF, followed by water depth and sea-ice concentration. That is, found principally in waters south of the sbACC during summer, minke whales were most abundant near the outer edge of the continental shelf (shallow depth), including areas heavily covered by sea ice. We propose that as the sbACC moves south and sea ice disappears, as projected by global climate models, minke whale habitat will shrink, and likely intra- and inter-specific competition will increase.},

abstract = {The management of fisheries resources in the northwestern Mediterranean is traditionally centralized and developed within the framework of coastal states and European Union common policies. In general, it has not been sufficiently effective in reversing the declining situation of fisheries resources and fishers in this region. This paper discusses the feasibility of moving away from a top-down approach in fisheries management towards a more participative and convergent mode of governance in the region. More specifically, the study focuses on MPAs as a fisheries management tool and evaluates their current establishment and management system in the French Mediterranean as a case study for the region. A brief review of the experiences on fisheries and MPA management in the Philippines is also presented to obtain insights on bottom-up and collaborative management approaches. Finally, possible opportunities for adopting a more decentralized and coordinated approach in fisheries management within the French socio-political system, and possibly in the northwestern Mediterranean region, are discussed. These include the existence of fishing community organizations in the region, such as the prud'homies in France and cofradias in Spain, starting with management strategies that are simpler to enforce and more acceptable to direct users, e.g., fishery reserves, and exploring co-management arrangements to manage fisheries at ecologically meaningful but operationally manageable scales as has been proposed by some development organizations. However, effective changes in the system would require major national policy and institutional reforms, social preparation and organizational strengthening which would take time and resources.},

The distribution of rent is governed by administrative rule which opens the possibility of profitable rent seeking. Cost of control is assumed to increase as rent per boat increases. Control outlays are assumed to be determined so as to maximize gains to the general public. It is shown that the optimal size of the fishing fleet exceeds the size that maximizes fishery rent.

The period of analysis covers the period 2002-2011. Financial data for those firms were collected from the ICAP Hellas. The results suggest that productivity increases with the size of the firm; age is not a significant determinant while exports are critical for their productivity, as well as profitability. Efficient management of resources is also important, as well as profitability and productivity can promote the competitiveness of Greek fisheries.},

abstract = {The risks and benefits associated with a given fishery-management measure, such as choice of a total allowable catch (TAC), depend on how future measures are to be chosen. It is therefore more appropriate to assess the risks and benefits of procedures or algorithms for determining management actions rather than those of single actions. The properties of a management algorithm can be explored by simulating its behaviour in hypothetical test scenarios. In each scenario, annual data with random error are generated from a simulated fishery and used by the algorithm to determine the TAC or other management measure for the next year. The performance of a management algorithm is measured against a variety of competing criteria that reflect the extent to which it achieves the conservation of fish resources, allows a reasonable level of utilization, and provides an acceptable degree of stability in catch or effort limits. Through an iterative process of testing and development, a management algorithm can be found that is robust towards uncertainties and that can be tuned to provide the desired trade-off between competing performance goals. The approach is illustrated using the Catch Limit Algorithm developed for the management of baleen whale harvests. (C) 1999 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

While I am sure that John M.

abstract = {Several factors, including dwindling ocean fish stocks, the high price of wild fish, and the commercial success of enclosed fish farming, have rekindled interest in enhancing natural stocks by the release of artificially raised individuals into the ocean environment. Due to ecosystem interrelationships and constraints, enhancement of fish stocks, irrespective of the purpose, generally has far-reaching biological consequences. Therefore, it almost invariably also has economic and social consequences well beyond those of relevance to the stock enhancers themselves. There are, in other words, external effects associated with ocean stock enhancement. This article is concerned with these problems. It develops a simple theoretical model for investigating the essential external effects of ocean stock enhancement. On the basis of this model, it is demonstrated that a stock enhancement industry will generally not release the correct number of individuals into the ocean. More surprisingly, perhaps, the analysis also shows that if stock enhancement is going on, conventional fishing activity should be modified. The article goes on to discuss institutions and mechanisms that would correct the problem. Theoretically, the appropriate mix of taxes and subsidies could, in principle, do the job. Another, probably more efficient method, consists of the implementation of individual property rights in the form of tradable harvesting and fish release quotas or licenses.},

abstract = {Despite knowledge-brokering being of high interest to public policy, there is a lack of research integrating the knowledge of stakeholders and scientists, principally because public policies remain viewed as top-down controlled. To help European research policies make a positive difference to society, there is a need to better engage stakeholders with the delivery of research and to demonstrate an impact and value that it brings. The pertinent question addressed by this communication is: how can a deeper and more systematic engagement of stakeholders be enabled through European research activities? Enabling stakeholder participation in European research activities requires there to be an incentive for researchers and stakeholders to engage, and the capacity of stakeholders to operate effectively in the research framework. Unsurprisingly, the establishment of communications and cultures conducive to shared problem solving is high priority, as is the need to work towards a governance structure that helps link research with policy outcomes, while at the same time resonating directly with stakeholders. The Regional Advisory Councils could be a strong force in bringing stakeholders knowledge to bear on the scientific issues relevant to management, but their strategy and capacity to mobilise the skills to do so are not yet ready.},

abstract = {Achieving a balance between fishing capacity and fishing opportunities is one of the major challenges in European fisheries. One way to achieve this is to introduce individual tradable quotas or similar management measures. In several mackerel and herring fisheries in the Northeast Atlantic, such systems have already been introduced on a national basis and the long term economic gains of this have been acknowledged. This paper takes this a step further and investigates the potential economic gains from introducing individual tradable quotas between countries. Overall, the results show that the gross cash flow can be improved by 21{\%} by allowing the mackerel and herring quotas to be traded internationally in the Northeast Atlantic. This rent gain arises mainly from increased productivity by allowing tradability between areas and fleets. The analysis also shows that the Danish pelagic fleet will gain from increasing its share of mackerel and herring quotas, whereas the Irish fleets are incentivised to sell quota, if individual quotas are allowed to be traded among countries. This result is in line with the qualitative analyses that show that Irish fishermen targeting herring in the Celtic Sea are negatively oriented towards international individual tradable quotas, whereas the Danish pelagic fishermen have strong preferences for international individual tradable quotas.},

The objective of the study was achieved using stochastic frontier production function and measuring technical efficiency through error component model. The study has revealed that there is potential for increasing fish production in Tripura and there was significant difference between the mean technical efficiency of adopted (0.86) and non-adopted (0.77) villages in the state. Study estimated the production elasticities for different input variables like fish seed, cow dung, lime, pellet feed, mustard oil cake, rice bran, labour, and showed the possibilities to increase fish production by using more quantities of all the inputs except fish seed. Study also analysed the potential production frontier by following scientific recommendations and the technical efficiency realised for both categories of villages was found to be lesser than the potential. The results of the present study helped to identify the scope for technical improvement in fish culture development in Tripura State of India.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Iceland's fishing industry has outperformed fishing industries in neighboring countries in recent years. This paper identifies key factors in market structure in recent decades that contribute to long run profitability of the Icelandic fishing (and fish processing) industry using semi-structured interviews with industry participants, and compares those with similar results from Norway. Further, the development of profitability in the Icelandic and Norwegian demersal fishing industries is used to assess the long run effects of different management systems on quality, product focus and profitability. The results indicate that three key changes in Icelandic regulation during the 1980s were important to the development of long run profitability within the fishing industry: the abolition of export barriers, the introduction of an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system and the establishment of fish auctions. A large and growing literature supports the role of ITQs in ensuring long run profitability. The importance of market structure for profitability has only recently been identified, affecting the ability of value chains to become market oriented and supply homogenous product flow from heterogeneous raw material. Comparison with Norway indicates that while individual transferable quota management does improve profitability in fishing to a certain extent, management systems must facilitate a strong market connection from consumers, through the stages of retail and processing, to fishers for the full realization of profit potential in the fishing industry.},

Co-management of fisheries, broadly defined as the involvement of users in management, developed in Europe in various experimental forms of participation of fishermen in the management process, in advisory roles or through delegation and sharing of power. During its history, fisheries co-management has been revealed as multi-functional, addressing different knowledge and resource management problems, with varying success. This analysis focuses on knowledge-related issues that are important for the functioning of co-management, especially the combination of scientific and local knowledge. First we review European literature on co-management and secondly we analyse two exemplary case studies (EU Regional Advisory Councils and Fisheries Local Action Groups). Thereupon the possibilities for future development of co-management in Europe are discussed with regard to knowledge integration and environmental governance. Under the influence of the ideas of adaptive governance and sustainable resource management, modifications of forms and functions of co-management systems are described.},

abstract = {A broad literature seeks to assess the importance of schools, proxies for school quality, and family background on children's achievement growth using the education production function. Using rich data from the Philippines, we introduce and estimate a model that imposes little structure on the relationship between intake achievement and follow-up achievement and evaluate school performance based on this estimated relationship. Our methods nest typical value-added specifications that use test score gains as the outcome variable and models assuming linearity in the relationship between intake and follow-up scores. We find evidence against the use of value-added models for our data and show that such models give very different assessments of school performance in the Philippines. Using a variety of tests we find that schools matter in the production of student achievement, though variation in performance across schools only explains about 4.4–5.3{\%} of the total (conditional) variation in follow-up achievement. Schools providing basic facilities—in particular schools providing electricity—are found to perform much better in the production of achievement growth.},

Cooperatives have the potential to enhance small-scale fishing livelihoods and participate in sustainable resource governance. However, promoting cooperatives' suc-cess entails developing a realistic understanding of the political and economic contexts in which they operate. Drawing on interview and census data, the analysis employs the theory of club goods to examine how the neoliberalization of Mexican fisheries policies in the 1980s and 1990s has affected cooperatives' ability to provide members with collective benefits, and thus the success and failure of fishing co-operatives in the region. In general, neoliberalization has reduced support to fishing cooperatives and generated greater challenges for their success in Yucat{\'{a}}n. The results of this study are likely relevant to many other small-scale fisheries in the South that have undergone similar processes of neoliberalization.},

abstract = {The introduction of vessel-based Individual Transferable Quotas (ITQs) in Danish demersal fisheries in 2007 caused significant structural changes in the fleet, towards fewer and larger vessels deploying otter trawls. Mainly smaller coastal vessels deploying Danish seines and gillnets reduced in numbers. The ecosystem effects of this structural change were investigated by comparing the sustainability of a local, small-scale, coastal fishery (Thorupstrand) using Danish seines and gillnets with that of demersal trawling by larger vessels using the same fishing grounds. The fisheries were compared using six ecological and socio-economic indicators: 1), discards (food web), 2), by-catch incidences (food web/biodiversity), 3), seabed impacts, 4), fuel use efficiency, 5), quality of fish landed (food provision), and 6), social and cultural gains and drawbacks (social and cultural features). Except for by-catch of vulnerable species, the fisheries using Danish seines and gillnets scored better in all indicators when compared to otter trawls. Additional commercial and cultural benefits of establishing a local fishery guild with share-owned quotas and land-based facilities were investigated. The results and lessons learned are discussed in the context of an ecosystem approach to fisheries management and the current reform of the common fisheries policy of the European Union.},

While Solow residuals are sufficiently volatile, these imply frequent technological regress. Productivity studies permitting unobserved factor variation find much smaller technology shocks, suggesting the imminent demise of real business cycles. However, we show that greater factor variation also dramatically amplifies shocks: a RBC model with varying capital utilization yields realistic business cycles from small, nonnegative changes in technology.},

abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of " pretty good yield " , implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

The author then looks at the question, what made it possible for the developed world to escape from what could be called the Malthusian trap during the nineteenth century? According to the author, the answer is the creation of knowledge. The author explains that there was an explosion of knowledge over the past two centuries that made possible an unparalleled increase in per capita well-being. New technologies have been developed at a rate unparalleled by historical standards. Three major factors are emphasized in the paper: the significant advances in agricultural productivity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the enormous increase in knowledge over the past two centuries; and the response of families to the removal of restraints on their well-being imposed by limited food supplies.},

The previous spawning history determines the number of times that a fish is exposed to riverine impacts that contribute to overall mortality rates. The model is designed to incorporate the kinds of data typically collected for anadromous Alosa stocks, such as catch-at-age data, spawning escapement counts at fish ladders, larval and juvenile abundance indices, and turbine mortality estimates. We show how the model can be adapted to individual stocks and management questions and how the model parameter estimates can be obtained using maximum likelihood. We demonstrate this approach with examples for two alewife Alosa pseudoharengus populations in Nova Scotia.},

abstract = {Since 1996, the demersal fisheries for cod, haddock, and saithe in Faroese waters have been regulated by a combination of fishing licenses, effort quota (days fishing), and area closures. The number of days initially allocated aimed at exerting an average annual fishing mortality rate of 0.45 on each of the three species. Considering that these stocks are taken in mixed fisheries, it had been hypothesized that effort would be targeted at the most available species, resulting in lower fishing mortality on the less available species, allowing them to recover. We review ten years of experience with the management system with special focus on the under-lying assumptions. Although the system appears to have achieved an appropriate balance in catch opportunities among the different fleet components and has minimized interference among gears, the objective of controlling fishing mortality on cod and saithe below the stated objective has not been achieved, partly because the original number of days allocated to fishing was too high. Also, there is no evidence that fleets switch target species according to relative abundance of all three species, which was one of the underlying assumptions of the effort management system. In view of the impact of major changes in productivity on stock development and exploitation, the current system cannot be expected to ensure spawning-stock biomasses above safe biological limits without a large reduction in the number of days allocated.},

We used Malmquist indexes to measure productivity change and explored the impact of changes in stock conditions and in regulatory policies on productivity levels. During the time period analysed, the measures defined by regulatory entities included allowing the use of a new type of dredge and the establishment of fishing quotas per vessel and per species.

This study examines the technical efficiency of the fishing industry, and identifies factors that could be causing inefficiency. A stochastic production function among fishery vessels is estimated. Technical efficiency measures the ability of firms to maximize output using a given set of inputs and technologies. The results indicate that technical efficiency in the fishery is relatively low, and that wooden vessels of medium size are more efficient than small fibreglass vessels. Both skippers' socio-economic drivers and vessel instrumentation have a significant impact on efficiency. Ownership of two-way radio and ownership of GPS are important considerations that influence fishing efficiency, and the skipper's level of education and experience are qualities that also affect it. Owner-operated vessels and younger skippers are more efficient than others. Understanding these constraints may contribute to increasing the efficiency of the Iranian fishery in the Persian Gulf. {\textcopyright}2006 International Council for the Exploration of the Sea.},

abstract = {According to a recent World Bank report, the intensification of global fishing effort and the ensuing depletion of marine fish stocks causes economic losses of 50billion US dollars annually. Data deficiencies, however, currently hamper analysis of global fishing effort. We analyzed data from the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the EUROPA fishing fleet registry, and peer-reviewed and other publications, to determine the global trends in fishing effort from 1950 to 2006. Our results show that global fishing effort, expressed as total engine power and the number of fishing days in a year (kilowattdays), was roughly constant from 1950 to 1970, and then steadily increased up to the present. Europe dominated global fishing effort, followed by Asia. Projecting current trends suggests that Asia will soon surpass Europe. Trawlers contribute a major fraction of global fishing effort, as do vessels greater than 100 gross registered tons. Current estimates of global fishing effort, the number of vessels, and total vessel tonnage are, however, underestimates given the data gaps that we have identified. Our results are useful in the following ways: (1) they may encourage researchers in academia and government to improve global fishing effort databases; (2) they allow deeper global analyses of the impact of fishing on marine ecosystems; (3) they induce caution in accepting current underestimates of economic losses of global fisheries; and (4) they reinforce calls for a reduction in global fishing effort.},

abstract = {A two-stage biomass dynamic model for Bay of Biscay anchovy is presented. Compared with the model currently applied by ICES for$\backslash$nthe assessment of that stock, the new model separates the growth and natural mortality processes and allows them to differ by age class. Stochastic equations involving the observed weights by age class in surveys are incorporated to provide information on growth$\backslash$nrates. The fishing process is modelled separating fishing mortality into year and age-class effects in each semester, and observation$\backslash$nequations are introduced for total catch and catch proportion by age class (in biomass) by semester. The model is first tested on simulated data, then applied to real data for the years 1987--2008. Although the results are affected by survey catchability and natural mortality assumptions, estimates of population trends, when expressed in relation to the value in a given year, are robust. The new model has significantly more parameters, requiring longer computational time for its fitting, which is done in a Bayesian context. However, it does allow the testing of different assumptions on natural mortality, which is of special interest after the recent fishery closure, and estimating new parameters, which could provide further insight on stock and fleet dynamics.},

abstract = {Fisheries management, as it is currently done in most countries, ignores the community level. Instead, it is almost exclusively based on a relationship between a government agency and individual users. This paper calls for a stronger emphasis on the roles that communities can play in fisheries management. Effective resource management is a necessary condition for the viability of fisheries communities, but I argue that viable communities are also an important contribution to the preservation of healthy fish stocks. Thus, before one can hope to rebuild fish stocks, one must start to rebuild communities; one cannot succeed without the other. The paper also offers some reflections on solutions and strategies, in particular on co-management as a potential community-building institution and how communities can play a supportive role in fisheries co-management.},

A few small-scale planning efforts were completed in state waters, and the Obama Administration proposed a framework for large-scale regional MSP throughout the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone. During that same time period, the authors engaged a variety of U.S ocean stakeholders in a series of dialogs with several goals: to share information about what MSP is or could be, to hear stakeholder views and concerns about MSP, and to foster better understanding between those who depend on ocean resources for their livelihood and ocean conservation advocates. The stakeholder meetings were supplemented with several rounds of in-depth interviews and a survey. Despite some predictable areas of conflict, project participants agreed on a number of issues related to stakeholder engagement in MSP: all felt strongly that government planners need to engage outsiders earlier, more often, more meaningfully, and through an open and transparent process. Equally important, the project affirmed the value of bringing unlike parties together at the earliest opportunity to learn, talk, and listen to others with whom they rarely engage. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Consolidation of the New England groundfish fleet has been commonly cited as a potential consequence of the newly implemented catch share management system. However, the New England Fisheries Management Council has yet to implement policies to protect the interests of small - scale fishermen or to maintain geographic and fleet diversity. Smaller fishing operations are less competitive than lar ger fishing corporations and are typically the first to go when fisheries switch to catch share management. Inaction by the Council stems from disagreements amongst members as to the extent of consolidation resulting in the disenfranchisement of small - scal e fishing interests, largely due to a lack of data of the subject. This masters project investigates the nature and avenues for consolidation over the major management shifts in this fishery, characterizing how the fleet has changed over time. A combinat ion of resources were used to conduct this assessment including primary and secondary sources of literature, informal interviews with key informants in the field, and data requested from the National Marine Fisheries Service. Additionally, policy mechanis ms used elsewhere to protect fleet diversity are explored, including accumulation limits and community quota entity programs. These mechanisms are then incorporated into several management approaches such as the existing sector program and Individual Trans ferable Quotas (ITQs) which are compared to determine which would most effectively protect the continued participation of small - scale fishing interests, resulting in fleet diversity and a more disperse geographical distribution of participants. The results from this analysis show that the groundfish fleet in New England has consolidated considerably over the major management shifts both as a result of direct government attempts to reduce fleet size through vessel and permit buyouts and because of unintended consequences of regulations, marginalizing small - scale fishermen. This study finds that the Council should continue with the current catch share management approach via fishing sectors, but incorporate community quota entity programs in order t o assist existing community efforts.},

An example is purse seine fisheries that target several species over the season but are specialized in the sense that each species are targeted individually. Such fisheries are typically modeled as either independent single species fisheries or using standard multi species functional forms characterized by jointness in inputs. We argue that production of each species is essentially independent but that jointness may be caused by competition for fixed but allocable input of vessel capacity. We develop a fixed but allocatable input model of purse seine fisheries capturing this particular type of jointness. We estimate the model for the Norwegian purse seine fishery and find that it is characterized by non-jointness, while estimations for this fishery using the standard models imply jointness.(JEL Q22, C51)},

abstract = {Supervisors occupy central roles in production and performance monitoring. We study how heterogeneity in performance evaluations across supervisors affects employee and supervisor careers and firm outcomes using data on the performance system of a Scandinavian service sector firm. We show that supervisors vary widely in how they rate subordinates of similar quality. To understand the nature of this heterogeneity, we propose a principal-agent model according to which supervisors can differ in their ability to elicit output from subordinates or in their taste for leniency when rating subordinates. The model also allows for variation in how informed firms are about this heterogeneity. Within the context of this model, we can discern the nature of the heterogeneity across supervisors and how informed firms are about this heterogeneity by relating observed supervisor heterogeneity in ratings to worker, supervisor, and firm outcomes. We find that subordinates are paid significantly more, and their pay is more closely aligned with performance, when they are matched to a high-rating supervisor. We also find that higher raters themselves are paid more and that the teams managed by higher raters perform better on objective performance measures. This evidence suggests that supervisor heterogeneity stems, at least in part, from real differences in managerial ability and that firms are at least partially informed about these differences. We conclude by quantifying how important heterogeneity in supervisor type is for workers' careers. For a typical worker, matching to a high rater (90th percentile) relative to a low rater (10th percentile) for just one year results in an increase in the present discounted value of earnings equivalent to 7-14{\%} of an annual salary.},

abstract = {This paper examines the allocation problem arising from conflicting demands for marine resource use by (i) commercial fishers, (ii) recreational fishers, and (iii) conservationists. It is shown that decentralised trading of individual transferable quotas (ITQs) is capable of an efficient allocation of resource use between the first two parties. In contrast, it is found that the standard ITQ system is not capable of performing the same ideal co-ordination between the conflicting interests of extractive users, that is, all fishers, and the non-extractive ones, that is, conservationists. The reason is that quota trades between individual fishers and conservationists are inevitably accompanied by (positive) externalities on both other fishers and conservationists. As a result, decentralised quota trades between these parties cannot be efficient. The fundamental economic observation is that quotas for conservation and for extraction constitute two different goods. It follows that a socially optimal market allocation of these two goods requires two prices instead of the single quota price in the standard ITQ system. Thus, to achieve efficiency, the ITQ system has to be extended to incorporate both types of goods. It is shown in the paper that if fishers and conservationists can organise themselves into groups, trades of conservation quotas between the two groups can in principle lead to fully efficient allocation. An interesting implication of this modified ITQ system is that the need for a fisheries authority to set the total allowable catch (TACs) disappears.},

Several judgements have been based on these premises. The aim of this article is to illustrate that the Icelandic fishery management system has by no means been a 100 {\%} ITQ system since 1984, and that alloca-tion of fishing licenses and quotas in the demersal fisheries in Iceland has been far more complicated than the aforementioned understanding would indicate. In fact since 1984 the Icelandic system has evolved more by trial-and-error than by design, and a substantial portion of the demersal quota shares have been reallocated. These reallocations should influence how the system is judged and evaluated.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2015 Elsevier Ltd. A landing obligation was formally implemented in the European Union (EU) for the first time, as part of the recent reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Given the reasonable success of the landing obligation in some countries such as the Faroe Islands, Iceland and Norway, this policy is seen as a viable approach to tackle the long-recognized discarding problem in EU waters. However, there has been some debate on whether there is sufficient evidence to support the feasibility of such a measure in the EU-CFP. The EU landing obligation will implicitly include all small-scale fisheries (SSF) provided the species captured are subject to catch limits or minimum sizes (in the case of the Mediterranean). SSF were included irrespective of the fact that the discarding problem in the EU has been historically associated with medium- to large-scale fleets (in particular largely mixed species trawl fisheries). Additionally, past experiences with a discard ban policy are still limited to specific countries and/or specific fisheries. This paper examined the appropriateness and feasibility of the recently implemented EU landing obligation in SSF. The effects in the long-term are unpredictable, but available evidence suggests that in the short to medium-term a landing obligation is likely to bring more negative social, economic and ecological impacts than benefits.},

In the early 19th century most inequality was due to differences within countries; later, it was due to differences between countries. Inequality in longevity, also increased during the 19th century, but then was reversed in the second half of the 20th century, perhaps mitigating the failure of income inequality to improve in the last decades.},

A conceptual model of results based management in fisheries is proposed as a way for public authorities to delegate specific management and documentation responsibilities to resource users. The model comprises three defining features: (1) That authorities define measurable objectives for the utilization of fisheries resources; (2) that resource users are made responsible for achieving these objectives and for (3) providing documentation that allows for an audit of the extent to which they are met. Selected cases are used to illustrate these features.

abstract = {In recent years a greater emphasis has been placed on developing management strategies that prevent over-exploitation. Harvest control rules (HCRs) have therefore, in many places, been developed and implemented. Commonly these HCRs are developed for stocks that are assessed using age-structured models, and various platforms exist to evaluate their performance and analyze various sources of bias for that particular class of models. Many stocks, however, cannot be assessed reliably using classical age-structured methods due to data limitations (gaps in data series, unreliable age readings, etc.). One such stock is the common ling (Molva molva) in Icelandic waters. Availability of data on the stock dynamics, in particular age data for both survey and commercial samples, has been a limiting factor when assessing the stock. When modeling stocks such as this, data limitations need to be considered, and how associated uncertainty is propagated both through the assessment and into the advice. In this study, ling was assessed using the size- and age-structured model Gadget after synthesizing all available data. Having limited age data available causes high uncertainty in the model fitting process, especially in estimating growth. However, including this key uncertainty in the assessment allowed the subsequent management strategy evaluation to take it into account directly while deriving common management reference points and estimating uncertainties in stock status and other derived quantities. Uncertainty was estimated using a specialized bootstrap for disparate data sets that mimics the sampling process. The process of assimilating data for the assessment model and the bootstrap procedure was performed using a specialized database program, MFDB, ensuring that the whole process is reproducible.},

In most studies the matching function is considered to be exogenous and assumed to have certain properties. The present study, instead, looks at the properties of an endogenous matching function. For this purpose we have programmed an agent-based computational labor market model with endogenous job creation and endogenous job search behavior. Our simulations suggest that the endogenous matching technology is subject to decreasing returns to scale. The Beveridge curve reveals substitutability of job searchers and vacancies for a small range of inputs, but is flat for relatively high numbers of job searchers and vertical for relatively high numbers of vacancies. Moreover, the matching technology changes with labor market policies. This raises concerns about the validity of labor market policy evaluations conducted with flow models of the labor market that employ exogenous matching functions.},

abstract = {An age-length structured model was built for European hake Merluccius merluccius in the central Mediterranean Sea using Gadget. This analytical framework allowed to integrate multiple sources of information, including fisheries-dependent and fisheries-independent data, collected at different scales and aggregation levels. The model includes the two main fisheries targeting hake in the area, the trawl and the gillnet fisheries, and account for differences in their selectivity and effort. Alternative models were used for testing different assumptions on recruitment and growth. The model is then used to predict the main trajectory of the stock during the next years and to evaluate the potential effects of implementing closed areas management scenarios in the hake nurseries as a specific tool to reduce fishing mortality on recruits. The modelling framework presented performed successfully also in a commercial landing data limited context, common for the Mediterranean. Our results provide statistical support for fast growth and multiple recruitment events assumptions. Including both these key features represent an unprecedented improvement of modelling hake population dynamics in the Mediterranean. We found that the reduction in the fishing effort that characterized the fisheries in the study area during the last few years, coupled with fast recovery abilities of the hake stock, has the potentiality to allow a moderate increase of the stock during the next years. Interestingly, our simulations show that the positive effects which might be expected from protecting hake nursery grounds are only marginally related to a reduction in hake recruits fishing mortality. Although our model relies on assumptions and surely represents an over-simplification of the real world, it still contributed to improve our understanding of the temporal dynamics of one of the most valuable fish stocks in the central Mediterranean. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {C an economic growth be sustained in the long run? If so, what deter-mines the long-run rate of growth? Which economies will grow the fastest? And what kinds of policies can governments use to accelerate advances in living standards? These questions were central for those who studied growth in the 1950s and 1960s, and remain so in the recent revival of interest in long-run economic performance. Two observations have motivated many of the recent contributors to growth theory. First, output expansion has outpaced population growth in the 200 years since the industrial revolution. Second, different countries have remained on seemingly disparate growth paths for relatively long periods of time. Related to this second observation is another: in cross-section and time-series data, we find national and regional growth rates correlated with a variety of economic, social, and political variables, including many that are affected by government policies. These observations have led the current generation of growth theorists to formulate models in which per capita income grows indefi-nitely and long-run performance reflects structural and policy parameters of the local and global economy. With this apparent similarity of intentions, recent research efforts have headed in several different directions. One strand of theory continues to see capital accumulation—though conceivably with a broad interpretation of "capital" that includes human capital—as the driving force behind economic growth. In the work of Jones and Manuelli (1990), King and Rebelo (1990), and Rebelo (1991), firms continually add to their stocks of capital in a perfectly competitive environment with constant returns to scale. Perfect competition requires that this capital be paid its marginal product, which must stay above the (subjective) discount rate for investment to remain profitable. The authors simply posit a lower bound on the private return to capital as a property of the aggregate production function, thus assuring that investment continues to be profitable. A second approach casts external economies in a leading role in the growth process. According to this view, when individuals or firms accumulate new capital, they inadvertently contribute to the productivity of capital held by others. Such spillovers may occur in the course of investment in physical capital (Arrow, 1962) or human capital (Lucas, 1988). As Romer (1986) has pointed out, if the spillovers are strong enough, the private marginal product of (physical or human) capital can remain permanently above the discount rate, even if individual investments would face diminishing returns in the absence of the external boosts to productivity. 1 Growth can be sustained by continuing accumulation of the inputs that generate the positive externalities. These two approaches offer logically coherent explanations of sustained, policy-sensitive growth. Moreover, they lend many insights into the theoretical properties of dynamic models. But, in our view, they do not identify the mechanism by which real-world growth truly is sustained. It seems to us—as indeed it did to Schumpeter (1934), Solow (1970, p. 33), and countless others —that improvements in technology have been the real force behind perpetually rising standards of living. Also, we believe that most technological progress requires, at least at some stage, an intentional investment of resources by profit-seeking firms or entrepreneurs. This perspective has led us to join Romer (1990), Aghion and Howitt (1992), and others in developing formal models that cast industrial innovation as the engine of growth. With the aid of these models, one can now investigate whether a decentralized market econ-omy provides adequate incentives for rapid accumulation of commercial technology, and one can examine how variations in economic structures, institutions, and policies translate into different rates of productivity gain. This paper will not attempt to review the burgeoning theoretical literature on "endogenous growth." Rather we have two more modest objectives in mind. First, we hope to convince the reader that purposive, profit-seeking invest-ments in knowledge play a critical role in the long-run growth process. Second, 1},

abstract = {Catch-at-age (or catch-at-length) data are one of the major components of most modern statistical stock assessment methods. Catch-at-age data provide, among other things, information about gear selectivity and recruitment strength. Catch-at-age data can also have a large influence on the estimates of fishing mortality, absolute abundance, and trends in abundance. The multinomial distribution describes the theoretical sampling process that is used to collect catch-at-age data, but only under the assumption of random sampling. Sampling designs generally employed to collect fishery-related data lead to age-composition estimates that depart from the strict theoretical multinomial probability distribution. Lack of independence can, for example, be due to size- or age-specific schooling or aggregating, causing positive correlations among individuals, and overdispersion. An additional cause of inadequacy of the multinomial assumption is model misspecification. Therefore, the effective sample size that should be used in an assessment model can be much smaller than the actual sample size. This can cause inappropriate weighting among data sets and negatively biased estimates of uncertainty. I use simulation analysis to evaluate five methods to estimate the effective sample size for catch-at-age data: (1) iterative multinomial likelihood; (2) normal approximation, using binomial variance; (3) lognormal likelihood with variance proportional to the inverse of the proportion; (4) Dirichlet likelihood; and (5) a multivariate normal approximation. The results show that all five methods perform similarly, but do not reduce estimation error relative to using the actual sample size unless the effective sample size is about one fifth of the actual sample size. All but (4) produced positively biased estimates of the effective sample size. If the effective sample size is not known within half an order of magnitude, I recommend using the lognormal likelihood with variance proportional to the inverse of the proportion and a regression against the actual sample size. This method is less computationally intense than (1), more robust than (2) and (4), and produces the least biased estimates of effective sample size, except for (4). Unlike (1), it can be included in Bayesian analysis. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier B.V.},

In the subsequent literature the development of research leading up to this paper tended to be forgotten. However, studying this diffusion of ideas may give valuable insights into research issues still unexplored and insight in the research process itself. A natural starting point is Farrell's seminal 1957 paper on concepts of efficiency and their computation. The richness of ideas presented in Farrell is demonstrated by the fact that the developments in the following two decades were based on aspects and ideas there.

A goal of the NOAA Fisheries social vulnerability and resilience indicator program is to support time and cost effective use of readily available data in furtherance of both social impact assessments of proposed changes to fishery management regulations and climate change adaptation planning. The use of the indicators to predict the response to change in coastal communities would be enhanced if community level analyses could be grouped effectively. This study examines the usefulness of combining 1130 communities into 35 relevant subgroups by comparing results of a numerical taxonomy with data collected by interview methods, a process herein referred to as “ground-truthing.” The validation of the taxonomic method by the method of ground-truthing indicates that the clusters are adequate to be used to select communities for in-depth research.},

abstract = {This paper presents a critique of expected utility theory as a descriptive model of decision making under risk, and develops an alternative model, called prospect theory. Choices among risky prospects exhibit several pervasive effects that are inconsistent with the basic tenets of utility theory. In particular, people underweight outcomes that are merely probable in comparison with outcomes that are obtained with certainty. This tendency, called the certainty effect, contributes to risk aversion in choices involving sure gains and to risk seeking in choices involving sure losses. In addition, people generally discard components that are shared by all prospects under consideration. This tendency, called the isolation effect, leads to inconsistent preferences when the same choice is presented in different forms. An alternative theory of choice is developed, in which value is assigned to gains and losses rather than to final assets and in which probabilities are replaced by decision weights. The value function is normally concave for gains, commonly convex for losses, and is generally steeper for losses than for gains. Decision weights are generally lower than the corresponding probabilities, except in the range of low probabilities. Overweighting of low probabilities may contribute to the attractiveness of both insurance and gambling. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1979 The Econometric Society},

@article{Norse2012,
abstract = {As coastal fisheries around the world have collapsed, industrial fishing has spread seaward and deeper in pursuit of the last economically attractive concentrations of fishable biomass. For a seafood-hungry world depending on the oceans' ecosystem services, it is crucial to know whether deep-sea fisheries can be sustainable. The deep sea is by far the largest but least productive part of the oceans, although in very limited places fish biomass can be very high. Most deep-sea fishes have life histories giving them far less population resilience/productivity than shallow-water fishes, and could be fished sustainably only at very low catch rates if population resilience were the sole consideration. But like old-growth trees and great whales, their biomass makes them tempting targets while their low productivity creates strong economic incentive to liquidate their populations rather than exploiting them sustainably (Clark's Law). Many deep-sea fisheries use bottom trawls, which often have high impacts on nontarget fishes (e.g., sharks) and invertebrates (e.g., corals), and can often proceed only because they receive massive government subsidies. The combination of very low target population productivity, nonselective fishing gear, economics that favor population liquidation and a very weak regulatory regime makes deep-sea fisheries unsustainable with very few exceptions. Rather, deep-sea fisheries more closely resemble mining operations that serially eliminate fishable populations and move on. Instead of mining fish from the least-suitable places on Earth, an ecologically and economically preferable strategy would be rebuilding and sustainably fishing resilient populations in the most suitable places, namely shallower and more productive marine ecosystems that are closer to markets.},

In equilibrium, this redistributes wealth towards less able individuals, reduces the likelihood that any given match will be rejected and, given the conditions, it yields efficiency.

This warming, if it occurs, is likely to have a significant impact on marine ecosystems and the size, yield, location and range of many commercial fish stocks. This prospect raises several problems for the European Union Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). First, given these expected changes, what would be the optimal time path for total allowable catches (TACs), fishing fleets, fishing methods and so on? Second, since the geographical location and range of many fish stocks are likely to change, possibly quite dramatically, allocations of TAC-shares to member states may become increasingly anomalous resulting in various kinds of strain on the CFP and the principle of relative stability. A similar but potentially more acute problem applies with respect to commercial fish stocks shared with non-member states. Altered location and behaviour of these fish stocks may render existing international agreements regarding the sharing of yield from these stocks obsolete giving rise to serious international disputes. It appears that marine environmental changes in the North Atlantic with the mackerel stock currently undertaking unprecedented migrations far beyond the EU jurisdiction into the EEZs of Iceland and the Faroe Islands are already causing problems of this kind. ?? 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Genetic data are becoming increasingly important in ecology and conservation biology. This article presents a novel method for estimating population size from DNA profiles obtained from a random sample of individuals. The underlying idea is that the degree of biological relationship between individuals in the sample reflects the size of the population and that DNA profiles provide information about relatedness. A pseudolikelihood approach is taken, involving pairwise comparison of individuals. The main field of applications is seen to be catch data, and as an example, the method is applied to DNA profiles (10 microsatellite loci) from 334 North Atlantic minke whales. It is concluded that the sample size is too small for the method to give useful results. The question about the required sample size is investigated by simulation.},

abstract = {Summary Increasing the eco-efficiency of fishing fleets is currently a major target issue in the seafood sector. This objective has been influenced in recent years by soaring fuel prices, a fact particularly relevant to a sector whose vessels present high energy consumption rates. Efforts to minimize fuel consumption in fishing fleets result in economic benefits and also in important reductions regarding environmental impacts. In this article, we combine life cycle assessment (LCA) and data envelopment analysis (DEA) to jointly discuss the operational and environmental performances of a set of multiple, similar entities. We applied the 'five-step LCA + DEA method' to a wide range of vessels for selected Galician fisheries, including deep-sea, offshore, and coastal fleets. The environmental consequences of operational inefficiencies were quantified and target performance values benchmarked for inefficient vessels. We assessed the potential environmental performance of target vessels to verify eco-efficiency criteria (lower input consumption levels, lower environmental impacts). Results revealed the strong dependence of environmental impacts on one major operational input: fuel consumption. The most intensive fuel-consuming fleets, such as deep sea trawling, were found to entail the diesel consumption levels nearest to the efficiency values. Despite the reduced environmental contributions linked to other operational inputs, such as hull material, antifouling paint, or nets, these may contribute to substantial economic savings when minimized. Finally, given that Galicia is a major fishing region, many of the conclusions and perspectives obtained in this study may be extrapolated to other fishing fleets at the international level.

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) are one of the property rights instruments that have been employed to improve economic efficiency in fisheries. ITQs are not high-quality property rights in the basic fundamental marine resources on which fisheries are based. As a result ITQs cannot be expected to generate full efficiency in the use of these resources. This article examines to what extent ITQs are capable of generating economic efficiency in fisheries. It is shown that ITQs can greatly improve efficiency in fishing. Moreover, by including recreational fishers in the system, ITQs can strike an efficient balance between commercial and recreational fishing. On the negative side, it is shown that on their own, ITQs are not capable of generating full efficiency in fisheries. In particular, ITQs are not sufficient for setting the socially optimal total allowable catch, ensuring the optimal use of the ecosystem, or harmonizing fishing with conflicting uses of marine resources such as marine tourism, mining, and conservation. Potentially counteracting these limitations, ITQ holders as a group have an incentive to manage overall ecosystem use for the long-term benefit of their fishery and negotiate the adjustment of their fishing activity toward the interests of conflicting uses of the marine resources.

abstract = {This paper provides a brief description of the origin, evolution, structure and performance of the ITQ (individual transferable quota) system in the Icelandic fisheries. The current ITQ fisheries management system in Iceland was instituted gradually over a period of 15 years. An IQ (individual quota) system was initially imposed in the herring fishery in 1975 and transformed into a fully fledged ITQ system in 1979. An IQ system was introduced in the capelin fishery in 1980 and turned into an ITQ system 1986. An ITQ system was introduced in the demersal fisheries in 1984. Since 1990 all fisheries within the Icelandic EEZ (exclusive economic zone) have been subject to a uniform system of individual transferable quotas with only minor exceptions. The system, however, is still evolving and consequently subject to further modification and change. The paper discusses the social and economic impetus for the initial adoption of the ITQ fisheries management system in the various fisheries, sketches its subsequent development and describes the main features of the current system. It presents assessments of the biological and economic impact of the ITQ system and discusses its future prospects. The paper finds clear evidence of positive biological and economic impacts of the ITQ system in the herring and capelin fisheries. In the demersal fisheries, the evidence is more mixed although also in these fisheries there is evidence of substantial economic benefits stemming from the ITQ system.},

abstract = {The United Nations' ‘Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries' urges governments to manage multiple yield, bycatch, and habitat attributes of fishery resources. The information and enforcement costs of multi-attribute management are high, however. As a result, relatively few attributes (generally stock biomass, age structure, and growth) are specified in yield targets, exposing others (e.g., localized abundance, sex) to excessive use in the public domain. Spillovers caused by fishing gear (e.g., gear conflicts, bycatch, habitat damage) generally are regulated with catch limits and area closures that artificially divide or exclude activities which interact due to attribute jointness. Total fishery income is compromised because tradeoffs are not evaluated at the margin. Alternative arrangements that bundle fishery resource attributes are suggested. Bundled property rights could evolve from a comprehensive assignment of usufruct rights which reduce the transaction costs of gathering information on unspecified attributes and of contracting for spillovers. Markets for harvest rights could resolve the simpler gear conflict and bycatch problems. Other interactions (e.g., predation, habitat requirements) would require corporate or collective property rights and governance arrangements that make harvesters and other interested parties the residual claimants of their harvest decisions, subject to government restrictions that protect public goods.},

Reasonable assumptions about the distribution of preferences over race, class, and school characteristics suggest that the segregating choices of students from advantaged backgrounds are likely to outweigh any integrating choices by disadvantaged students. The results of our empirical analysis are consistent with these theoretical considerations. Using information on the actual schools students attend and on the schools in their assigned attendance zones, we find that schools in Durham are more segregated by race and class as a result of school choice programs than they would be if all students attended their geographically assigned schools. In addition, we find that the effects of choice on segregation by class are larger than the effects on segregation by race.},

The development of a model to assess the importance of capelin abundance to cod, and the corresponding impact of the capelin fishery on cod is therefore of some importance. Similarly, in assessing the abundance of shrimp, understanding the impact of cod predation might be expected to improve both the understanding of population dynamics and abundance estimates. Modelling these scenarios requires multispecies, multiarea, multifleet models. In both cases the spatial overlap of the predator and prey needs to be taken into account. There are also large temporal changes in the availability of capelin as prey as they are only present on the Icelandic shelf for part of the year. Each of these species has different modelling requirements and differing levels of data availability.

abstract = {Fisheries managers often face the challenge of addressing multiple, conflicting objectives. Historically, the focus has been on biological objectives but there has been an increasing appreciation of the im-portance of economic and social objectives. A desire to address economic objectives has partly driven the increasing use of individual transferable quotas (ITQs). However, ITQs are insufficient to achieve the economic objectives as a suite of other decisions and regulations affect outcomes. Assignment problems are common in ITQ fisheries and can reduce economic yield. They occur through misallocation of fishing effort, particularly when there is spatial and temporal heterogeneity in the stock, leading to inefficient timing of supply and overexploitation and congestion in parts of the fishing grounds. Clubs in the form of fishing cooperatives have the capacity to resolve these problems through coordinating the fishing effort of their members. The likelihood of a single fishing cooperative forming and uniting to resolve assign-ment problems however, may be diminished under ITQ management due to the increasing heterogeneity in business structures, incentives and motivations among fishers generated by market-based mechan-isms. This heterogeneity can also have ramifications for fishers trying to reach an agreed industry po-sition that can be presented to government when negotiating on management changes that deal with assignment problems. In this situation, the absence of an agreed industry position should not act as an impediment to government in prioritising, articulating and taking the lead in implementing measures that reduce assignment problems and concurrently meet their overarching economic objectives.},

abstract = {The Faroe Islands are currently struggling to find their feet in a new context of globalisation and changing international requirements on fishery management best practices, as exemplified by United Nations protocols and agreements. We introduce the Faroese fisheries effort management system for cod, haddock and saithe, which represents an innovative attempt to tackle the challenges of mixed fisheries by means of a combination of total allowable effort implemented through days-at-sea and extensive use of closed or limited access areas. Subsequently, we present and discuss controversies concerning the system's ability (or lack thereof) to achieve a level of fishing effort that produces long-term sustainability. Over the years the system has proved able to evolve and overcome challenges, and the Faroe Islands are currently considering adding a proper fisheries management plan to the system to achieve fishing at maximum sustainable yield. However, finding support for this plan presents a challenge due particularly to an enduring gap between the perspectives of scientists and actors in the catching sector. Finally, we outline some actions that could be taken to reduce the gap and hence facilitate reform of the system: 1) integration of the consultative/advisory process; 2) obtaining tailor-made advice for the Faroese effort management system from the relevant scientific body; 3) establishment of a transparent mechanism for monitoring and regulating fishing effort; 4) clarifying the efficacy of the prevalent system of closed areas.},

abstract = {Purpose – The potential for e-commerce is limited by a trust deficit when traders do not interact in a physical, bricks-and-mortar context. The theory
of information richness posits that equivocal interactions, such as ones requiring trust, can be facilitated through communication media that transmit
multiple cues interactively. This study aims to examine the potential of information-rich virtual worlds to reduce this trust deficit compared with more
traditional Web-based e-tailing environments.
Design/methodology/approach – Rather than focusing on stated intentions, the authors adopt an experimental approach to measure behaviour.
Participants receive performance-related financial incentives to perform trust games in different information-rich treatments that represent three
retail environments: a physical environment representing bricks-and-mortar trade, an electronic environment representing Web-based online retailing
and a virtual environment representing virtual world retail.
Findings – The authors find that the two dimensions of trust significantly differ between the treatments. In particular, as hypothesised, both
trustingness and trustworthiness are higher in the virtual than in the electronic environment. However, contrary to the hypotheses, physical trade
is not associated with greater trust than virtual trade.
Research limitations/implications – The authors extend previous research by demonstrating how the information richness of the virtual world
interface can promote e-commerce by deepening trust between trading partners. This research also complements existing work that approaches
product and service interfaces through the lens of servicescapes.
Practical implications – The findings also contribute towards the development of services marketing practice and the design of e-commerce environments.
Originality/value – Much of the work in this space considers purchase intentions and attitudes around trust, whereas this study looks at actual
trust behaviour in the virtual space.},

The model is used to analyze the probable effects of harvesting strategies on biomass, catch, and economic benefits from the exploitation of these species. Simulations are used to investigate probability profiles of biological and economic variables, taking into account inaccuracies in assessments and uncertainties in predictions. Optimal harvesting strategies are also investigated using a deterministic version of the model and taking into account problems of unemployment, overcapacity, and aversion to fluctuations in consumption. The analysis shows that it is beneficial to reduce fishing from the cod stock in order to allow the stock to recover to its optimum size. This increase in the cod stock will result in big decreases in the catch of capelin and shrimp.},

This paper identifies key factors in market structure in recent decades that contribute to long run profitability of the Icelandic fishing (and fish processing) industry using semi-structured interviews with industry participants, and compares those with similar results from Norway. Further, the development of profitability in the Icelandic and Norwegian demersal fishing industries is used to assess the long run effects of different management systems on quality, product focus and profitability. The results indicate that three key changes in Icelandic regulation during the 1980s were important to the development of long run profitability within the fishing industry: the abolition of export barriers, the introduction of an individual transferable quota (ITQ) system and the establishment of fish auctions. A large and growing literature supports the role of ITQs in ensuring long run profitability. The importance of market structure for profitability has only recently been identified, affecting the ability of value chains to become market oriented and supply homogenous product flow from heterogeneous raw material. Comparison with Norway indicates that while individual transferable quota management does improve profitability in fishing to a certain extent, management systems must facilitate a strong market connection from consumers, through the stages of retail and processing, to fishers for the full realization of profit potential in the fishing industry.},

abstract = {A scientific bottom trawl survey targeting Pacific rockfishes (Sebastes spp.) occasionally yields extraordinary catch events (ECEs) in which catch-per-unit-area is much greater than usual. We hypothesize that ECEs result from trawl catches of fish shoals. We developed mixture distribution models for positive catch rates to identify spatial covariates associated with ECEs or normal trawl catches and used simulation modeling to contrast the performance of mixture distribution and conventional log-linear models for estimating an annual index of positive catch rates. Finally, mixed-effects modeling was applied to multispecies data to evaluate the hypothesis that ECEs are related to shoaling behaviors. Results show that mixture distribution models are often selected over conventional models for shoaling species and that untrawlable habitat has a positive effect on rockfish densities. Simulation shows that mixture distribution models can perform as well as or better than conventional models at predicting positive catch rates. Finally, model selection supports the hypothesis that shoaling behaviors contribute to the occurrence of ECEs. We propose that greater understanding of ECEs and shoaling habitat selection could be useful in future spatial management and survey design and that mixture distribution models could improve methods for estimating annual indices of abundance.},

Using a new primary data set on public ownership that contains detailed information on privatization in 20 countries between 1980 and 2007, we test these claims empirically in relation to state ownership. We pay special attention to the question of whether changes in the international political economy, notably globalization and different aspects of European integration, condition partisan politics. Our empirical findings suggest that political parties have continued to significantly shape national privatization trajectories in line with the classic partisan hypothesis. While partisan differences are somewhat reduced by the liberalizing and market-building efforts of the European Union, globalization does not condition partisan effects. Moreover, the run-up to the European Monetary Union even seems to have reinforced partisan differences.},

abstract = {Fishing communities are subject to economic risk as the commercial fisheries they rely on are intrinsically volatile. The degree to which a community is exposed to economic risk depends on a community׳s ability to confront and/or alter its exposure to volatile fishery conditions through risk-reduction mechanisms. In this article, economic risk – as measured by community-level fishing gross revenues variability – is characterized across Alaskan fishing communities over the past two decades, and exploratory analyses are conducted to identify associations between community attributes and revenues variability. Results show that communities' fishing portfolio size and diversification are strongly related to fishing revenues variability. Communities with larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios experience lower fishing revenues variability. Portfolio size and diversification appear to be related to the number of local fisheries, indicating that communities' portfolios may be constrained to the set of local fisheries. Hotspots of relatively higher fishing revenues variability for communities in north and west Alaska were identified, mirroring the spatial distribution of fishery-specific ex-vessel revenues variability. This overall pattern suggests that a community׳s fishing portfolio – and hence its exposure to risk – may be “predetermined” by its location, thereby limiting the policy options available to promote economic stability through larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios. For such communities, diversifying income across non-fishing sectors may be an important risk reduction strategy, provided any potential negative cross-sector externalities are addressed.},

Relying on a standard job search and matching framework and empirical evidence from a wide array of labor market indicators, we examine whether the natural rate of unemployment has increased since the recession began, and if so, whether the underlying causes are transitory or persistent. Our preferred estimate indicates an increase in the natural rate of unemployment of about one percentage point during the recession and its immediate aftermath, putting the current natural rate at around 6 percent. An assessment of the underlying factors responsible for this increase, including labor market mismatch, extended unemployment benefits, and uncertainty about overall economic conditions, implies that only a small fraction is likely to be persistent.},

However, it has been widely acknowledged that the approach by many governments worldwide to achieve compliance is largely through law enforcement efforts.

By drawing on criminology and security discourse, and on empirical research on small-scale fisheries in South Africa, this paper argues for a new approach to our understanding of compliance.

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine consumer attitudes toward online shopping in Jordan. The paper introduces an integrated model which includes trust, perceived benefits, perceived web quality, and electronic word of mouth (eWOM) along with their relationships in order to examine their effects on consumer attitudes toward online shopping. Design/methodology/approach – A structured and self-administered online survey was employed targeting online shoppers of a reputable online retailer in Jordan; i.e. MarkaVIP. A sample of 273 online shoppers was involved in the online survey. A series of exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were used to assess the research constructs, unidimensionality, validity, and composite reliability. Structural path model analysis was also used to test the hypothesized relationships of the research model. Findings – The empirical findings of this study indicate that consumer attitudes toward online shopping is determined by trust and perceived benefits. Trust is a product of perceived web quality and eWOM and that the latter is a function of perceived web quality. Hence, trust and perceived benefits are key predictors of consumer attitudes toward online shopping, according to the results. Further, the authors also found that higher levels of perceived web quality lead to higher levels of trust in an online shopping web site. Perceived web quality was found to be a direct predictor of trust, and the former positively and significantly influences perceived benefits. Also, the authors found that 28 percent of the variation in online shopping attitudes was caused by perceived benefits and trust. Research limitations/implications – The research sample included only early adopters who are usually described as personal innovators and risk takers. Future research is encouraged to focus on other groups such as non-adopters to understand their online shopping attitudes. Another limitation is derived from the geographical context of the current study; that is Jordan. The findings are not necessarily applicable to other Arab countries and the rest of the world. Therefore, replications of the current study in different countries would most likely strengthen and validate its findings. Also, the study is cross-sectional which does not show how attitudes of consumers may change over time. The authors encourage future studies to employ a longitudinal design to understand the changes in consumers' attitudes toward using online shopping over time. Finally, this study examined only one case in point and thus findings cannot be generalized to other online shopping web sites. Future research is highly encouraged to examine consumers' attitudes toward other online shopping web sites inside and outside Jordan. Practical implications – The paper supports the importance of trust and perceived benefits as key drivers of attitudes toward online shopping in emerging markets like Jordan. It further underlines the importance of perceived web quality contribution to perceived benefits and trust as well as the key role},

abstract = {Rights-based management (RBM) has been proposed during the last two decades as a means to counteract the race for fish in the Peruvian pelagic fishery. Recently, the government has decided to implement RBM in the pelagic fisheries in the form of a system that allocates individual quotas for vessels licensed to harvest Peruvian anchoveta. The aim of this paper is to analyse the introduced individual vessel quota (IVQ) system and to identify factors that may have the potential to either aid or undermine the achievement of the objective of reducing the race for fish. The non-transferability characteristic of the vessel quota may aid protecting the social fabric from concentration of rights. A substantial fleet reduction, however, may not be achieved. Measures to permanently eliminate redundant capacity and thus the threat of the race for fish may be required. Such measures should comprise either decommissioning schemes or instruments to regulate transferability. {\textcopyright}2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Harvest strategies for the northern shrimp (Pandalus borealis) population in Kachemak Bay, Alaska, were analyzed using a length-based population model under various levels of instantaneous fishing mortality (F) and a biomass-based management threshold (BBMT). With constant instantaneous natural mortality (M) ≤0.4 or constant recruitment (R), threshold management, i.e. closing the fishery at population levels below BBMT, is unnecessary when the fishery is managed with an optimal fishing mortality rate (Fopt). However, for a population with a Beverton-Holt recruitment relationship, threshold management is essential to reduce the risk of population extinction. The robustness of establishing guideline levels for F to misspecification of M and R was examined with values of M and R set higher than, lower than, or equal to their perceived true levels. Assessment surveys were assumed to occur once every 1 to 3 years. Underestimation of M results in Fopt values associated with higher cumulative yield and higher risk of falling below population-at-risk threshold taken to be 20{\%} of virgin spawning stock biomass. More frequent surveys help to reduce this risk. On the other hand, misspecification of R has very little effect on forecasting population abundance if the population is sampled annually. Less frequent sampling induces higher risk if R is specified too high, but it has little effect if R is specified too low. In conclusion, frequent sampling and good understanding of M are essential for sound management of fisheries such as those for northern shrimp in Kachemak Bay.},

abstract = {Critical analyses of neoliberalism[U+05F3]s influence on fisheries governance have documented how enclosure, quota leasing and renting, and commodification can precipitate negative social consequences for fishing communities. By contrast, this paper draws on the concept of embeddedness to argue that certain policies and social relations can regulate enclosure, quota renting, and commodification in ways that empower community-based groups to facilitate the anchoring of fishery resources and wealth in coastal communities. It does so through an analysis of northern shrimp fisheries in Newfoundland and Labrador, Canada, between the 1970s and the early 2000s. This case study illustrates how fisheries enclosure policies informed by geographically and morally defined principles of access and equity and limits on commodification can meaningfully embed fishery resources and benefits in rural and remote coastal regions that depend on small-scale fishing. Although the application of social principles continues to be marginalized in the context of neoliberal policy regimes that privilege individual economic efficiency over distributive concerns, this paper provides new insight into the conditions under which principles of ethical allocation and distribution of resources are able to persist through an era of neoliberalism.},

I derive bounds on structural price elasticities that are a function of the observed effect of a price change on demand, the size of the price change, and the degree of frictions. The degree of frictions is measured by the utility losses agents tolerate to deviate from the frictionless optimum. The bounds imply that frictions affect intensive margin elasticities much more than extensive margin elasticities. I apply these bounds to the literature on labor supply. The utility costs of ignoring the tax changes used to identify intensive margin labor supply elasticities are typically less than 1{\%} of earnings.As a result, small frictions can explain the differences between micro and macro elasticities, extensive and intensive margin elasticities, and other disparate findings. Pooling estimates from existing studies, I estimate a Hicksian labor supply elasticity of 0.33 on the intensive margin and 0.25 on the extensive margin after accounting for frictions.},

abstract = {About 25{\%} of the world's fisheries are depleted (1) such that their current bio-mass (B CUR) is less than the biomass that maximizes the sustained yield (B MSY). We show that, if B CUR were compared to the bio-mass that produces the largest discounted eco-nomic profits from fishing (B MEY), many more stocks would be considered overexploited, i.e., B MEY {\textgreater}B MSY and B MEY {\textgreater}B CUR. A classic result (2) is that it may be optimal for a private owner to overexploit to extinction a renewable resource with low reproductive ca-pacity, whereas B MEY may be either greater or smaller than B MSY depending on the discount rate, sensitivity of costs and revenues to biomass and harvest, and the marginal growth in the biomass (3). We show that under reasonable prices, costs, and discount rates it is not eco-nomic to exploit fisheries to extinction even with very low growth rates. Moreover, we found that B MEY exceeds B MSY . With use of perturbation methods (4), we solved for optimal stochastic harvest and biomass transition paths to B MEY , specified revenues as a nonlinear function of harvest, and allowed for a " stock effect " such that costs are a nonlinear function of the biomass. Model outputs for four different fisheries are presented (Fig. 1) where equilibrium revenue and economic profit curves (in thousands of U.S. dollars) are plotted against equilibrium fish biomass or spawning stock (in tons). We mod-eled population dynamics with an age-structured model but used a spawner-recruitment model in the prawn fishery (5). The peak of the revenue curves corresponds to B MSY , whereas the maxi-mum of the economic profit curves equals B MEY . We found that B MSY {\textgreater}B CUR except for yellowfin tuna, but in all cases B MEY exceeded B MSY at a discount rate of 5{\%}. The profit two curve shows the sensitivity of the results to costs [extra 30 cents (U.S.) per liter of fuel] relative to the base-case profit one curve. Higher costs, lower output prices, and smaller discount rates increase the ratio of B MEY to B MSY . The profit curves show that the more overexploited the fishery, the greater the mar-ginal economic gains from stock rebuilding. Although the stock effect may be relatively small in some cases (6), our estimates indicate that it is large at current biomass, whereas har-vesting costs rise at an increasing rate with declines in the biomass. We also find that a discount rate as large as 25{\%} for the tuna and prawn fisheries and a discount rate as high as 10{\%} for orange roughy still generate B MEY {\textgreater}B MSY . In all cases, even at very high discount rates, fishing profits become negative long be-fore biomass is fully depleted. Theoretically, maximizing discounted eco-nomic profits may cause stock depletion or even extinction (2). Our results show, however, that in practice B MEY {\textgreater}B MSY. This implies a win-win: Conservation promotes both larger fish stocks and higher profits. When B MEY exceeds B CUR , the debate is no longer whether it is economically advantageous to reduce current harvests but how fast stocks should be rebuilt. Revisiting the economics of overexploitation provides both a target and a framework to help overcome a key cause of overharvesting: fisher opposition to lower catches associated with stock rebuilding. For fast-growing species, rebuilding to B MEY may only take a short time, but for very slow-growing fish it may take decades. Transition costs to B MEY may explain why fishers oppose stock rebuilding, as do stakeholder conflicts over whether to maximize short-run employment, to maximize discounted economic profits, or to achieve ecosystem con-servation goals (7). Appropriate incentives in the form of individual or community harvesting rights (8) can provide security to current fishers that they will benefit from stock rebuilding. Intertemporal transfers from higher, future profits in the form of a quota rental charge (9) could also compensate for transition costs and employment losses in moving to B MEY .},

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to explore the role of determinants of consumers' buying intentions for sustainable seafood. Design/methodology/approach – Survey data from 755 representative respondents in the UK were collected. Structural equation modelling was used to analyse the data. The theory of planned behaviour was used as a framework for the analysis, with an additional variable, personal norm, which seems to be especially relevant for environmental behaviour. Findings – The results confirmed the expected relationships: the motivation to buy sustainable seafood is increased by a positive attitude towards buying sustainable seafood, perceived pressure from important others such as family, friends and colleagues, and by a strong moral obligation. Attitude towards buying sustainable seafood was the strongest predictor of intention found in the study. To reach a goal of consumers placing greater emphasis upon purchasing more sustainable seafood, both attitudinal and normative messages could be used. Further implications of the findings and the scope for further research are discussed. Research limitations/implications – The study is correlational in nature, thus limiting the causal inferences that can be made from the results. It does, however, help to explain the relationships in explored in the model. Originality/value – This paper addresses the issue of motivation to buy sustainable seafood which has not received much attention in literature, but is an important issue for anyone trying to increase consumer sustainable behaviour.},

@article{Hannesson2007a,
abstract = {Since 1950, the real value of fish catches in Norway has about doubled, while the number of fishermen has declined by about 85 percent. This has made it possible to maintain fishermen's incomes roughly on par with other occupational groups in Norway. It is investigated to what extent this increase in labor productivity is due to accumulation of capital, increasingly abundant fish stocks, or technological progress. Since the capital stock in recent years is not much greater in real terms than in the early 1960s, it is tempting to ascribe most of the increase in labor productivity to technical progress. This, however, would leave out the role of fish stocks; if stocks have increased over this period, this would explain some of what otherwise appears as a technical progress. Using data on labor, capital, fish catches, and fish stock abundance 1961-2004 the development of total factor productivity is examined. Ignoring changes in fish stocks, total factor productivity is estimated to have increased by 0.8 percent per year. Accounting for changes in fish stocks raises this to 1.7-4.3 percent per year, depending on the importance assigned to stocks as factors of production. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {In this study, we developed a method of fractional parentage analysis using microsatellite markers. We propose a method for calculating parentage probability, which considers missing data and genotyping errors due to null alleles and other causes, by regarding observed alleles as realizations of random variables which take values in the set of alleles at the locus and developing a method for simultaneously estimating the true and null allele frequencies of all alleles at each locus. We then applied our proposed method to a large sample collected from a wild population of brown trout (. Salmo trutta). On analyzing the data using our method, we found that the reproductive success of brown trout obeyed a power law, indicating that when the parent-offspring relationship is regarded as a link, the reproductive system of brown trout is a scale-free network. Characteristics of the reproductive network of brown trout include individuals with large bodies as hubs in the network and different power exponents of degree distributions between males and females. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Performance measures and reference points for the management of target species are now widely used in the fisheries of the developed world. To move us closer to an ecosystem-based fisheries management framework, we look at the prospects for expanding current single-species approaches for target species, by considering nontarget species. We also examine the development of performance measures and reference points for emergent ecosystem-level properties. We conclude that the expansion of single-species reference points to take account of the nontarget species of a fishery is tractable and desirable. In contrast, the use of performance measures for a single or a small selection of ecosystem metrics is not possible at present, owing to the absence of a clear understanding of their dynamics and a lack of underlying theory to explain their behaviour. However, recent methods that aggregate a wide range of metrics to provide an overall picture of the ecosystem status show promise and have a particular attraction because they have the potential to provide a framework for establishing a dialogue on management issues between all interested parties.},

The authors' data show changes in state ownership in formerly public monopoly enterprises in telecommunications, electricity, and aviation sectors of 26 countries between 1970 and 2000. Combining various analytical techniques. the authors use partial-order scalogram analysis to visualize the similarity of institutional structures and country-specific development trajectories. By pooled time-series regression they show that only the liberalization of capital markets has a significant effect on infrastructure privatization. The effects of party ideology, veto players, or corporatist interest group systems are rather insignificant over the whole period. However, by an innovative use of yearly ordinary least squares regressions, they show that governmental ideology holds great predictive power for privatization in the 1980s but not for the 1990s, when almost all countries had privatized.},

abstract = {Most of the world's ocean fisheries are severely lacking in private property rights in the underlying natural resources or their close complements (e.g. harvesting volume). Therefore, according to standard property rights theory, these fisheries should be highly wasteful of potential economic rents from these resources. The question is whether this economic loss can be empirically verified and, if so, how large it is. This paper explains the concept and develops the analytical theory of economic and natural rents. Building on this and utilizing global fisheries data, the paper proceeds to esti-mate a global fisheries model, obtain numerical estimates of the rent loss in the world's ocean capture fisheries and provide reasonable confidence bounds for this loss. It is found that the global fisheries rent loss constitutes almost certainly a large fraction of the landed value of the global landings. The mean estimate of this loss is well over 50{\%} of the value of landings.},

The most valuable and urgent Interim Measure is that of joint scientific cooperation, which will facilitate more region-specific research and an increased understanding of the fisheries as well as the broader Arctic environment.

@article{Tascioglu2017,
abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of the study is to investigate consumers' perceptions of status motivations on retailers' sustainability efforts and whether
collectivism and materialism moderate this relationship.
Design/methodology/approach – A quantitative research methodology using survey data was used. Data were collected by administering
questionnaires from millennial respondents (n 386) from the USA and Turkey.
Findings – The results show that cultural value (collectivism) and materialism can serve as moderators of the effects of status motivation and
sustainability. The findings indicate that the link between status motivation and sustainability perceptions (both environmental and social
sustainability) is stronger for more collectivist consumers. In terms of materialism, while it did not moderate the relationship between status
motivation and perceptions of environmental sustainability, it did moderate the relationship between status motivation and perceptions of social
sustainability, particularly the uniqueness aspect of materialism.
Research limitations/implications – The stronger link between status motivation and both environmental and social sustainability for collectivists
suggests that the bandwagon effect may be impacting their need for status. The stronger link between status motivation and social sustainability
for those more materialistic suggests that their need for status may be more impacted by a snob effect as they want to appear unique. The use of
college students is a limitation of this study, and future research needs to explore a wider range of age groups to determine if there are generational
differences. Additionally, future research could examine other cultural dimensions such as power distance and masculinity versus femininity.
Practical implications – Findings from this research provide insights for retailers, especially those targeting the status and luxury market when
developing their sustainability plans. An interest in sustainability may aid consumers in meeting their need for status, particularly for those status
consumers who are more collectivist, as a means to fit in with their group. For more materialistic consumers, retailers may want to focus more on
unique social sustainability efforts that are more publicly noticeable.
Social implications – Social sustainability, a topic not studied as frequently as environmental sustainability, has significant implications for
consumers. The findings suggest that the link between status motivation and social sustainability is stronger for collectivists, suggesting a
bandwagon effect. Additionally, the authors find that the link between status motivation and social sustainability is stronger for materialists,
particularly the uniqueness dimension of materialism, suggesting a snob effect.
Originality/value – The originality of this study lies in the exploration of how status motivation impacts consumers' perceptions of retailers'
environmental and social sustainability efforts and if these relationships are moderated by collectivism and materialism. Few studies have examined
social sustainability, especially in terms of culture.

While vouchers are familiar in other fields of public services, the approach is completely novel in active labour market policy. The article contrasts the proclaimed advantages of vouchers in general (i.e. jobseeker choice and provider competition) with the problems of training vouchers in particular. Initial evidence suggests that information asymmetries, a lack of providers in certain areas and restricted opportunities for policy coordination are obstacles to full achievement of the positive effects hoped for by proponents of the training voucher.

abstract = {There is considerable ambivalence in how different societies and cultures relate to the consumption of luxury goods. Thinly focused in the literature are Islamic societies (with rapidly emerging ‘super-rich' consumer segments) where the concept of luxury may be in tension with religious values. Set against this background, this paper investigates how consumer values and motivation influence purchase intentions towards luxury goods. Based on a sample of 400 respondents drawn from Morocco and applying logistic regression models, the paper finds correlations between the intention to buy luxury goods, motivation and personal values. Paradoxically, the influence of religion appears to diminish as consumer affordability of luxury goods increase. Partly due to globalization of markets and impacts on consumer values, Moslems are not fundamentally different from western consumers with regard to predispositions towards luxury consumption. Potential impacts of religion on luxury consumption attitudes and personal values appear to be moderated by the global consumer culture. The results also show an important gender underpinning especially when considered alongside perceived gender biases in consumption decision-making in many Islamic countries. Regarding the nature of purchase behavior women were found to be more positively disposed to impulse purchasing of luxury goods compared to men while more educated people, generally, indicated a greater tendency towards rational than impulse buying decisions.},

In practice, however, the security of property rights over natural resources varies substantially; this may affect returns to ownership and asset values. We use an analytical model to examine the effects of insecure property rights to natural resources on the market value of assets. We then use a unique dataset of fisheries from three countries to examine empirically how differences in property rights affect market outcomes. We find significant asset market capitalization of insecurity arising from (1) ownership disputes, (2) illegal extraction from resource stocks, and (3) the possibility of government revocation of rights.},

abstract = {The article outlines the development of Iceland's fishery rights and the extension of its territorial waters between the 1950s and the mid-1970s, whereby Iceland gained exclusive control and use of the marine resources of the waters within 12, later 50, and ultimately 200 nautical miles around the island. The article concentrates on four of Iceland's main fisheries: shrimp, herring, capelin and cod. These four fisheries are discussed separately and in depth, presenting the beginnings and growth of the industry and detailing the development of management practices and the corresponding legislation and regulatory measures. Iceland's initial concern was to gain control over the marine resources surrounding the island, but once this was achieved, the focus of attention shifted to managing first the economic and soon also the ecological aspects of its tremendous resource. Informed mainly by indigenous expertise, Iceland's concern was to limit overfishing, manage its fisheries sustainably both from the economic and ecological points of view, and find the best ways to distribute the revenues from the marine harvest. The article looks at each of the four fisheries to clarify how the individual transferable quota (ITQ) system came into being, how initial quota holdings were allotted, and analyses the circumstances under which the ITQ system became the management tool of choice. For each fishery, the process of regulatory evolution was quite unique. At the same time, there is a common pattern to all the fisheries, which may be summarized as follows. Firstly, serious attempts to reform management practices only got underway when the fishery had collapsed or was close to collapse. Secondly, stakeholders invariably started the process of regulation by limiting access to the fishery. Thirdly, a variety of rules were implemented to allocate rights to participate in the fishery to additional entrants once membership had been closed. Finally, prior to the invention of the ITQ system, prices were used to manage fisheries in Iceland. It may be concluded that the management of fisheries by ITQs may be a historical accident, rather than the end point of a logical evolution.},

In the model, both harp seals and minke whale, and cod, prey on capelin, herring and cod, and in addition, herring prey on capelin larvae. Cod is the most important predator. Information on food preferences and food requirements obtained from the Norwegian research program on marine mammals is used to quantify the predation by marine mammals on fish. The sensitivity of the model to the stock sizes and food preferences of harp seals and minke whales is investigated, together with the sensitivity to the food preferences of cod. A tentative conclusion on likely effects of an increasing whale stock is that the herring stock will be most heavily affected. An increasing harp seal stock will most heavily affect the capelin and cod stock. The model is more sensitive to changes in the food preferences of cod than to changes in food preferences or stock sizes of marine mammals.},

The present study explores, across various consumers who have different motivations to engage with brands, the mechanism that enables perceptions of social relatedness to contribute to consumer engagement and relationship building. The results of the study reveal that consumers' perceived social relatedness moderates the effects of consumer motivation on engagement, consuming intention, satisfaction, affective commitment, and trust. The findings highlight the importance of fulfilling consumers' need for social relatedness in the context of social media, especially for those who are motivated to engage in brand activities via extrinsic factors.},

The most flexible transformation function in outputs and inputs used in textbooks is too general to make sense in pollution modelling. Specifying bads as if they are inputs, although may be defendable on a macro level as a reduced form, hides explicit considerations of various modification activities. Applying a non-parametric efficiency approach extended to cover bads as outputs, assuming weak disposability of the bads, has serious formal weaknesses as well as not accounting satisfactorily for abatement. Factorially determined multi-output production may be used to model generation of bads by making them being functions of the same set of inputs as in the production of good outputs. A complete taxonomy of inputs as to the impact on both residuals and marketed products as joint outputs is then derived. Factorially determined multi-output production can also be used to model end-of-pipe purification, observing the materials-balance principle, thus providing detailed information for choice of policy instruments. {\textcopyright}2009 F.

abstract = {The tropical rocklobster fishery in the Torres Strait, based on the species Panulirus ornatus, is currently managed by input controls. The Australian Commonwealth government's aim is to transition to a quota management system (QMS) for this fishery. The fishery is complex in terms of international boundaries, multiple jurisdictions and management objectives regulating a mix of commercial and traditional indigenous fishers and a commercial non-indigenous sector. One key objective is to promote indigenous fisher participation to meet their aspirations of achieving a greater control of the region's fisheries resources. A Bayesian Network analysis has been applied that considers the variability in participation of indigenous fishers under key economic and socio-cultural drivers, such as the availability of a government employment program, lobster prices, social capital and capacity, and infrastructure availability. The model identifies three distinct indigenous fisher groups: full-time, active part-time, and casual lobster fishers. Scenario analyses suggest that changes in the government employment program will have a substantial impact on the relative proportion of fishers in these groups. Similarly, changes in the provision of logistics, infrastructure, and building social capital and capacity are expected to have a significant impact on the occurrence of full-time fishing. As the Commonwealth has an obligation under the Torres Strait Treaty to protect the traditional way of life and livelihood of Islanders as well as promoting employment opportunities for Traditional Inhabitants, it is important that management authorities consider both the effect of management changes for the fishery as a whole and for each indigenous fisher group separately.},

abstract = {Governance of deepwater fisheries has a high profile in the international community, including the explicit attention of the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA). This attention reflects concerns about the sustainability of deepwater fisheries and the fragility of deepwater ecosystems, and concern that there is a gap in the international fisheries governance framework when it comes to deepwater fisheries on the high seas. Deepwater fisheries are considered by Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as those fisheries that occur beyond the continental shelf/slope break which typically occurs at about 200 metre (m). The current technological limit of these fisheries is about 2 000 m. However, many species not usually considered as deepwater are fished at depths well above 200 m (e.g. the North Pacific walleye Pollock fishery, one of the world's most productive, occurs over a range of 90- 500 m). According to the FAO statistical database, deepwater fisheries produced 5.9 million metric tonnes (t) in 2004 or less than 4 percent of the total production from fisheries and aquaculture (including freshwater). Most of this catch is of species that generally occur in depths of less than 500 m, and some of the species that account for much of the catch occur in shallow nearshore waters as well as beyond 200 m in depth. Deepwater fisheries should not all be "painted with the same brush" (or, in other words, hairtails and blue whiting are not the same "kettle of fish" as orange roughy and oreo dories) as there is a great deal of difference between the species fished in the shallow end of the range of deepwater fisheries, and species that are fished at depths centered below 500 m. Species fished in the shallow end of the range have similar biological characteristics to shelf species. They are productive compared to some deeper water species, such as orange roughy. The discourse about deepwater fisheries would be well served by a common understanding of what constitutes a deepwater fishery and what makes them different from other fisheries. Deepwater fisheries beyond 500 m generally have a history of less than three decades, during which early expectations of sustainable yield have often been too optimistic, the biomass on many fishing grounds has been depleted, and biogenic habitats have been impacted. The deepwater fisheries that have attracted the most attention are those for orange roughy at depths of about 700 m and below. Simply stated, the global track record for sustainable management of deepwater fisheries beyond 500 m is not good. Deepwater fisheries have failed to be sustainable for one or more of the following fundamental reasons: they have been unregulated; initial scientific assessments based on limited data have often been too optimistic; and/or management has not responded to, or has been slow to respond to, scientific advice calling for improved conservation. This experience clearly points to the need to strictly adhere to the precautionary approach and apply an ecosystem approach. More specifically all deepwater fisheries should be authorized by a competent management authority with constraints set cautiously, and new fisheries should have a development plan that ensures the rate of development is consistent with the gathering of knowledge; management strategies for deepwater fisheries need to be re-examined in light of the poor track record to date; in particular biological reference points should be set more conservatively and explicit "fishing down" phases should be avoided; steps need to be taken to address habitat and biodiversity impacts of deepwater fisheries; research is needed to improve resource assessments, knowledge about the distribution of resources off fishing grounds, understanding of stock structure, and understanding the functional value and vulnerability of habitat and biodiversity; new multilateral arrangements are needed to manage high-seas fisheries in some areas, although individual nations could prevent overfishing on the high seas if they consistently applied the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries (CCRF) and the Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas (Compliance Agreement); and there is a need to improve compliance with fishery conservation measures and reporting of fishery-dependent data. It is time to seriously consider extending catch documentation schemes, such as the Commission for the Conservation of Antartic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) scheme used to reduce illegal, unregulated, and unreported (IUU) fishing of toothfish, to all fish that enter into international trade. An unanswered question is, will the benefit-cost ratio for deepwater fisheries for long-lived, low-productivity species be positive if the full costs of research and management are taken into account?},

abstract = {Adult Pacific whiting (also known as Pacific hake), Merluccius productus, migrate each year from spawning grounds off southern California to feeding grounds along the continental shelf break from central California to Vancouver Island. During spring and summer, there are large-scale commercial fisheries for this species in both U.S. and Canadian waters. The stock synthesis model, a flexible, age-structured, maximum-likelihood estimation model, was used to investigate the migratory behavior of Pacific whiting. In this implementation of the stock synthesis model, the U.S. and Canadian zones were defined as separate geographic areas, and the parameters of an age-specific migration function were estimated. Annual coefficients were estimated for the parameter specifying the asymptotic proportion of an age class migrating into the Canadian zone for years with coastwide acoustic surveys (1977, 1980, 1983, 1986, 1989, and 1992). Correlation analysis between these coefficients and a suite of environmental variables revealed that the March-April water temperature anomaly at a depth of 100 m from 30 degree to 42 degree N lat. had the highest correlations. High water temperatures were associated with an increased proportion of the Pacific whiting population in the Canadian zone, as occurred during the 1982-83 and 1991-92 El Nino events, whereas in 1989, low water temperatures were associated with a decreased proportion in the Canadian zone. This relationship was used in the stock synthesis model to estimate migration curves for years in which no surveys were made. The results of the stock synthesis models and the correlation analysis suggest that El Nino events promote the northward movement of Pacific whiting via intensified northward currents during the period of active migration. Although estimates of total population abundance are unaffected by modeling the interannual variation in migration, the results provide additional information on the transboundary distribution of the stock, which is important for forecasting how long-term climate change affects the Pacific whiting population.},

abstract = {The Galapagos Islands are a prime example of a place where fishery management policies have been established without first understanding the behavior of fishermen. Since the creation of the Galapagos Marine Reserve in 1998, there has not been a single study in the archipelago that investigates fishing behavior and the factors affecting this behavior. This paper addresses this gap in the literature by describing and analyzing the decisions of the fishing fleet for the red spiny lobster fishery. It focuses on factors that affect the short-term decisions regarding both participation and intensity of participation in the lobster fishery. This paper finds that the fishing fleet in the Galapagos Islands behaves as profit maximizing firms, because they consider all the benefits and costs that affect both their participation decision as well as their decision about how frequently to be active after they have decided to participate. The results also show that there is a large latent effort in the lobster fisheries that could threaten the sustainability of any initiatives aimed at increasing catchability, prices, or markets. It is expected that this analysis will be valuable to policy makers when designing or improving the management plans for Galapagos fisheries.},

abstract = {Background/Context: The Equality of Educational Opportunity study is widely recognized as one of the most important studies on schooling ever performed. The findings from the report have shaped the field of education, national education policies, and wider public and scholarly opinion regarding the contributions of schools and schooling to equality and pro-ductivity in the United States. Despite past reanalyses of the data and decades of research on the effects of schools as organizations, the report's fundamental finding—that a stu-dent's family background is far more important than school social composition and school resources for understanding student outcomes—still retains much of its currency. Purpose/Objective/Research Question/Focus of Study: Using the original Equality of Educational Opportunity data, this study replicated Coleman's statistical models but also applied a two-level hierarchical linear model (HLM) to measure the effects of school-level social composition, resources, teacher characteristics, and peer characteristics on ninth-grade students' verbal achievement. Research Design: HLM allows researchers to disentangle how schools and students' family backgrounds contribute to learning outcomes. The methodology offers a clearer interpretation of the relative effects of school characteristics, including racial/ethnic composition, and fam-ily background, including race/ethnicity and social class, on students' academic outcomes. Findings/Results: Our results suggest that schools do indeed matter, in that when one exam-ines the outcomes across the national sample of schools, fully 40{\%} of the differences in achievement can be found between schools. Even after statistically taking into account stu-dents' family background, a large proportion of the variation among true school means is related to differences explained by school characteristics. Within-school inequalities in the 1202 Teachers College Record achievement outcomes for African American and White students and students from families of higher and lower social class are explained in part by teachers' biases favoring middle-class students and by schools' greater reliance on curriculum differentiation through the use of academic and nonacademic tracking. Conclusions/Recommendations: Formal decomposition of the variance attributable to indi-vidual background and the social composition of the schools suggests that going to a high-poverty school or a highly segregated African American school has a profound effect on a student's achievement outcomes, above and beyond the effect of individual poverty or minor-ity status. Specifically, both the racial/ethnic and social class composition of a student's school are 1 3/4 times more important than a student's individual race/ethnicity or social class for understanding educational outcomes.},

Despite the principles of EAF having now been outlined for 10 years, the rate of adoption has been lower than desirable to achieve international commitments. Many fishery managers still perceive EAF as too difficult to implement, but for most fisheries it can be relatively simple, especially with the tools now available. Consequently, the FAO initiated development of an EAF Toolbox to provide improved access to knowledge of the EAF process and tools suitable for its implementation. This toolbox (www.fao.org/fishery/eaf-net) uses a web based, expert system designed to help a wide variety of fishery stakeholders better understand EAF and assist with the selection of the most appropriate set of tools for their situation. Using the toolbox makes implementing EAF technically feasible for all fisheries irrespective of their value or the level of resources and data, but impediments including insufficient institutional, stakeholder and political commitment may still affect its adoption in some locations. {\textcopyright} 2014.},

We also examine whether and how disposition to trust mediates the effects between national culture and trustworthiness of an online store. We test the hypotheses with a sample of 616 online bookstore customers from China and Finland, countries that represent opposite cultural poles in many respects. We find that national culture solely explain 23{\%} of the variance in the consumer's general disposition to trust, and that disposition to trust is a highly significant predictor of the perceived trustworthiness of an online store. We further find that the mediating role of disposition to trust between national culture and trustworthiness depends greatly on the individual cultural dimension studied.},

The required data was obtained from a random sample of 520 fishery vessels. The results of the estimating metafrontier showed that mean technical efficiency for selected provinces varies between 0.408 and 0.542, while ranging between 0.650 and 0.728 when assessed according to the regional frontier. The highest mean technical efficiency based on metafrontier is devoted to Sistan-va-Baluchestan, while Bushehr has the lowest mean technical efficiency. The results also indicated that the main explanations, beyond the fact that Sistan-va-Baluchestan has the highest technical operation in comparison with other provinces are access to more suitable vessels and especially, access to the deeper water in the Oman Sea and Indian Ocean to fish the big pelagic species.},

This paper discusses the theoretical foundations of the Mincer model and examines the empirical support for it using data from Decennial Censuses and Current Population Surveys. While data from 1940 and 1950 Censuses provide some support for Mincer's model, data from later decades are inconsistent with it. We examine the importance of relaxing functional form assumptions in estimating internal rates of return to schooling and of accounting for taxes, tuition, nonlinearity in schooling, and nonseparability between schooling and work experience. Inferences about trends in rates of return to high school and college obtained from our more general model differ substantially from inferences drawn from estimates based on a Mincer earnings regression. Important differences also arise between cohort-based and cross-sectional estimates of the rate of return to schooling. In the recent period of rapid technological progress, widely used cross-sectional applications of the Mincer model produce dramatically biased estimates of cohort returns to schooling. We also examine the implications of accounting for uncertainty and agent expectation formation. Even when the static framework of Mincer is maintained, accounting for uncertainty substantially affects the return estimates. Considering the sequential resolution of uncertainty over time in a dynamic setting gives rise to option values, which fundamentally changes the analysis of schooling decisions. In the presence of sequential resolution of uncertainty and option values, the internal rate of return - a cornerstone of classical human capital theory - is not a useful guide to policy analysis.},

abstract = {The resource economic theory tells us that individual transferable quotas (ITQs) improve efficiency in the fishing industry by removing the least efficient actors from a fishery and allowing ownership to concentrate in the hands of the most efficient operators. Assertions about the nature of this allocative efficiency are, however, often based on purely theoretical assumptions. This paper presents a case study of the efficient operators remaining in the UK pelagic fishing fleet. After over 30 years of rights-based management (RBM) and 12 years of ITQs, the UK pelagic fleet numbers only 31 large-scale boats. Seven of these operate from the island of Whalsay in Shetland, which, with a population of approximately 1000 people (0.000016{\%} of the population of the UK), is entitled to land around 22{\%} of the UK pelagic catch. A key characteristic of the economically efficient Whalsay fleet is a crew ownership structure. This is now under threat from the long-term dynamics of the UK's ITQ system, as the high price of quota prevents the renewal of the fishery through new entrants. In the majority of global fisheries, where vessel ownership structures do not follow an assumed economic norm, fully marketised transferable rights may not be the most efficient method of management.},

abstract = {To address long-standing allocation conflicts between the Pacific halibut commercial fishing sector and recreational charter (for-hire) sector in Alaska, an Alaska halibut catch sharing plan (CSP) is being implemented in 2014 that has a provision allowing the leasing of commercial individual fishing quota to recreational charter businesses. This one-way inter-sectoral trading allows for the charter sector to increase its share of the total allowable catch while compensating commercial fishermen. This type of catch shares program is novel in fisheries. In this paper, the literature on non-fisheries tradable permit programs (TPPs) that have similarities to the Alaska halibut CSP program is examined. Several successful TPPs are discussed, including ones from emissions trading programs, water quality trading programs, water markets, and transferable development rights programs. They are then evaluated in terms of their similarities and differences to the Alaska CSP program. Characteristics not part of the current CSP that other TPPs have used and that may increase the likelihood for the CSP to be effective in achieving its primary goals (if they are implemented) are identified, such as allowing more flexible transfers (e.g., internal transfers), intertemporal banking, cooperative structures, and multi-year leasing.},

abstract = {This paper explores interactions between the two main avenues through which worker ability is signaled in the labor market — education signaling and promotion signaling. The framework assumes that workers are endowed with values for both academic ability and productive ability, where these abilities are positively correlated but are not identical. Workers use education to signal academic ability but firms care about productive ability which is signaled through promotion decisions. The main analysis yields three returns to education signaling: i) a higher starting wage; ii) higher wages for non-promoted workers late in careers; and iii) a higher probability of promotion. The paper shows that when education and promotion signaling co-exist education signaling fares better from a social welfare standpoint than in models characterized by education signaling only. Also, in contrast to standard models of education signaling, in this analysis there are important education signaling returns late in workers' careers.},

@inproceedings{Ulrich2017,
abstract = {Achieving single species maximum sustainable yield (MSY) in complex and dynamic fisheries targeting multiple species (mixed fisheries) is challenging because achieving the objective for one species may mean missing the objective for another. The North Sea mixed fisheries are a representative example of an issue that is generic across most demersal fisheries worldwide, with the diversity of species and fisheries inducing numerous biological and technical interactions. Building on a rich knowledge base for the understanding and quantification of these interactions, new approaches have emerged. Recent paths towards operationalizing MSY at the regional scale have suggested the expansion of the concept into a desirable area of “pretty good yield”, implemented through a range around FMSY that would allow for more flexibility in management targets. This article investigates the potential of FMSY ranges to combine long-term single-stock targets with flexible, short-term, mixed-fisheries management requirements applied to the main North Sea demersal stocks. It is shown that sustained fishing at the upper bound of the range may lead to unacceptable risks when technical interactions occur. An objective method is suggested that provides an optimal set of fishing mortality within the range, minimizing the risk of total allowable catch mismatches among stocks captured within mixed fisheries, and addressing explicitly the trade-offs between the most and least productive stocks.},

abstract = {Since the 1980s, so-called “rights-based” fisheries management regimes – specifically those designed to apply market forces to problems of inefficiency and overfishing by divvying up fixed, tradable proportions of a total allowable catch among individuals or cooperatives – have become both one of the most widely advocated and most contentious aspects of marine resource management. Iceland, promoted by some as a successful international model of this approach, has been the site – for nearly thirty years – of fierce debate and controversy regarding the system's effects on regional development, social justice and wealth disparity. This thesis uses a phenomenological approach, a set of ten semi-structured interviews, and document analysis to explore how inhabitants of the Icelandic Westfjords understand and articulate their ‘rights' in the context of fisheries management, particularly in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. Respondents discuss a range of perceived ‘rights' not usually considered in management design, most notably the right to ‘fate-control'. Discussions of rights-based management in the Westfjords reflect deeper concerns regarding identity, fear of change, democratic values and a sense of personal agency. 5},

This has led to a concern that increased aquaculture production poses a threat to the sustainability of capture fisheries.

Although we are not able to identify structural differences between these sectors, the empirical results show that fishmeal demand is price inelastic. Technological change, however, is reducing fishmeal usage in feeds, suggesting that strong demand pressure on pelagic fish resources targeted for fishmeal is a temporary phenomenon.},

abstract = {SUMMARY: We compare two Monte Carlo (MC) procedures, sequential importance sampling (SIS) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), for making Bayesian inferences about the unknown states and parameters of state-space models for animal populations. The procedures were applied to both simulated and real pup count data for the British grey seal metapopulation, as well as to simulated data for a Chinook salmon population. The MCMC implementation was based on tailor-made proposal distributions combined with analytical integration of some of the states and parameters. SIS was implemented in a more generic fashion. For the same computing time MCMC tended to yield posterior distributions with less MC variation across different runs of the algorithm than the SIS implementation with the exception in the seal model of some states and one of the parameters that mixed quite slowly. The efficiency of the SIS sampler greatly increased by analytically integrating out unknown parameters in the observation model. We consider that a careful implementation of MCMC for cases where data are informative relative to the priors sets the gold standard, but that SIS samplers are a viable alternative that can be programmed more quickly. Our SIS implementation is particularly competitive in situations where the data are relatively uninformative; in other cases, SIS may require substantially more computer power than an efficient implementation of MCMC to achieve the same level of MC error.},

abstract = {Fisheries are a complex mixture of social, political, economic, and biological aspects, and often biological or economic end goals are given priority in fisheries governance. However, there is a growing trend around the world to include non-economic social objectives in fisheries management schemes, e.g., supporting rural communities, increasing opportunities for newcomers or part-time fishermen, or providing equitable access for culturally and historically important fisheries. In Iceland, fisheries management has given biological and economic goals' precedence over social goals, and there is no formal inclusion of a social science advisory body or formalized direct input from all relevant stakeholders in the fisheries governance process. Non-economic social sciences such as geography, anthropology, sociology, and political science can add important information and considerations that in turn make fisheries more sustainable in the long run. In this paper, we explain the role of social science in fisheries governance, explore how social aspects are addressed in other fisheries governance schemes, and review highlights from fisheries social science research in Iceland. We hope to generate a meaningful conversation regarding the possibilities of a modern, pioneering fisheries' governance process in Iceland where social, economic, and biological goals and research are all given equal attention.},

The social, economic, and political significance of the five sectors and eNGOs in relation to the MSFD is presented, as well as a description of the stakeholder consultation process as experienced by representatives from the sectors and eNGOs, in addition to an illustration of the EU policy landscape associated with the sectors. Three central themes emerge in relation to implementing the MSFD and the ecosystem-based approach to management in EU marine waters: (a) Boundaries; (b) policy and management coordination; and (c) balancing values and user conflicts have been explored. The paper concludes that from a governance perspective it is clear that the MSFD has not been that well-thought through. The consistency of the overall legal frameworks and specific regulations related to marine management have created legal vagueness and subsequently caused legal uncertainties leading to conflicting policies and regulations having unclear boundaries. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated the dilemmas facing various sectors related to MSFD implementation and shown how unequally prepared different sectors are to participate in this policy.},

This process is well documented at the producer level in Asche (1997), Tveteras (2002), and Anderson (2002). A central argument for the successful growth in aquaculture has been increased control of the production process that allows market-oriented production and sales. However, with the exception of Zidac, Kinnucan, and Hatch (1992), little attention has been given to how these potential advantages have been exploited in the supply chain. Still, for increased aquaculture production productivity, growth in the supply chain is as equally important as productivity growth at the production level. A consumer only cares that a product has become less expensive, not at which level in the supply chain the productivity improvement caused the lower price to take place.},

The problem arises since decision makers (1) cannot blindly trust the service or its provider, and (2) ignore the environment within which the service is operating. The fact that no security mechanism is applicable in such a completely open environment, where identities can be easily generated and discarded makes social approaches such as trust and reputation models appealing to apply in the world of Web services. This survey classifies and compares the main findings that contributed in solving problems related to trust and reputation in the context of Web services. First, a high-level classification scheme partitions Web services into three main architectures: single, composite, and communities. Thereafter, a low-level classification within each architecture categorizes the trust and reputation models according to the technique used to build the trust value. Based on this classification, a profound analysis describing the advantages and shortcomings of each class of models is presented; leading to uncover possible topics that need further study and investigation. In particular, we discuss the challenging problem of having active malicious Web services in the composite and community-based architectures. Thus, the paper can be used by the future researchers as a roadmap to explore new trust and reputation models for Web services taking into account the shortcomings of the existing models.},

abstract = {The complex and dynamic nature of environmental problems requires flexible and transparent decision-making that embraces a diversity of knowledges and values. For this reason, stakeholder participation in environmental decision-making has been increasingly sought and embedded into national and international policy. Although many benefits have been claimed for participation, disillusionment has grown amongst practitioners and stakeholders who have felt let down when these claims are not realised. This review first traces the development of participatory approaches in different disciplinary and geographical contexts, and reviews typologies that can be used to categorise and select participatory methods. It then reviews evidence for normative and pragmatic benefits of participation, and evaluates limitations and drawbacks. Although few of the claims that are made have been tested, there is evidence that stakeholder participation can enhance the quality of environmental decisions by considering more comprehensive information inputs. However, the quality of decisions made through stakeholder participation is strongly dependant on the nature of the process leading to them. Eight features of best practice participation are then identified from a Grounded Theory Analysis of the literature. These features emphasise the need to replace a "tool-kit" approach, which emphasises selecting the relevant tools for the job, with an approach that emphasises participation as a process. It is argued that stakeholder participation needs to be underpinned by a philosophy that emphasises empowerment, equity, trust and learning. Where relevant, participation should be considered as early as possible and throughout the process, representing relevant stakeholders systematically. The process needs to have clear objectives from the outset, and should not overlook the need for highly skilled facilitation. Local and scientific knowledges can be integrated to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex and dynamic socio-ecological systems and processes. Such knowledge can also be used to evaluate the appropriateness of potential technical and local solutions to environmental problems. Finally, it is argued that to overcome many of its limitations, stakeholder participation must be institutionalised, creating organisational cultures that can facilitate processes where goals are negotiated and outcomes are necessarily uncertain. In this light, participatory processes may seem very risky, but there is growing evidence that if well designed, these perceived risks may be well worth taking. The review concludes by identifying future research needs. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) was used to test the assessment and management performance of three assessment methods in combination with harvest control rules. The assessment procedures considered were: the eXtended Survivors Analysis (XSA), the Schaefer production model, and the difference model. Four HCRs were considered: first, fishing mortality was set on the basis of the relationship between the current biomass and a reference biomass; second, fishing mortality was gradually reduced (or increased) until it reached a required target; and the third and the fourth HCRs were similar to the first and second but with imposed TAC constraints. The stock that was generated in the operating model (OM) resembled the eastern Baltic cod stock. For the XSA assessment, two options were used: XSA with default shrinkage of terminal fishing mortality to the average of the estimates, and XSA with low shrinkage. The simulations showed that for stock assessment, the XSA models performed much better than the difference and Schaefer models. However, for the data tested, the difference and Schaefer models performed somewhat better in terms of management performance than the XSA models, especially the XSA model with default shrinkage. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {The New Zealand ITQ system is a dynamic institution that has had many refinements since its inception more than 15 years ago. Nonetheless, the basic tenets of the system - setting a total allowable catch and leaving the market to determine the most profitable allocation of fishing effort - have remained intact. This paper assesses the New Zealand system to identify areas of success and/or possible improvement or expansion within it. The reasons for doing so are to highlight beneficial features and to identify features of the New Zealand ITQ system that are relevant to other potential tradable permit markets. Beneficial features include simple standardized rules for quota definition and trading across species and areas; very few restrictions on quota trading and holding; relative stability in the rules over time; and low levels of government involvement in the trading process. We find evidence that supports the assertion that fishers behave in a reasonably rational fashion and that the markets are relatively efficient. We do not find major changes in participation in these fisheries as a result of the system. We find evidence that suggests that the ITQ system is improving the profitability of fisheries in New Zealand. In general the evidence thus far suggests that the market is operating in a reasonably efficient manner and is providing significant economic gains. These factors suggest that New Zealand would want to have non-economic justifications for any significant changes to the system.},

abstract = {Marine protected areas created in a top-down way can be costly and ineffective due to low compliance of resource users. Conversely, employing users' local knowledge and involving them in decision-making processes could decrease costs and conflicts, in addition to increasing the chances of management success. Here the potential to change conflicting MPAs into conservation areas that take into account fishers' use and knowledge is assessed based on a case study on the Brazilian coast (Paraty town). Fishers (n=206) from 11 villages were interviewed regarding their main fishing targets and gear, and then only the experienced ones (n=41) were interviewed from three main fishing villages about the most important commercial species. Fish landings were sampled for one year in these three villages (n=823), where participatory mapping and group interviews with fishers were also conducted to determine their opinions regarding management and how they thought it should be undertaken. Management measures should not be equivalent across the whole region, as there were clear differences in the target species and gear used. Fishers identified 55 important fishing spots, eight of which were important for more than five villages, while the experts identified 10 important fishing areas for the target species, which was supported by the sampling of fish landings. The fishers were not opposed to management and no-take reserves but would make some changes in the current design of these measures if it were up to them. Based on these data, a few changes were indicated in the design of these areas that would likely reduce the conflict between fishers and enforcement agencies. This kind of approach could be used as a framework for adapting conflictive MPAs or to support the establishment of new ones where fisheries are relevant.},

abstract = {This paper clarifies and extends the classical Roy model of self selection and earnings inequality. The original Roy model, based on the assumption that log skills are normally distributed, is shown to imply that pursuit of comparative advantage in a free market reduces earnings inequality compared to the earnings distribution that would result if workers were randomly assigned to sectors. Aggregate log earnings are right skewed even if one sectoral distribution is left skewed. Most major implications of the log normal Roy model survive if differences in skills are log concave. However few implications of the model survive if skills are generated from more general distributions. We consider the identifiability of the Roy model from data on earnings distributions. The normal theory version is identifiable without regressors or exclusion restrictions. Sectoral distributions can be identified knowing only the aggregate earnings distribution. For general skill distributions, the model is not identified and has no empirical content. With sufficient price variation, the model can be identified from multimarket data. Cross-sectional variation in regressors can substitute for price variation in restoring empirical content to the Roy model.},

abstract = {The collapse and recovery of North Sea herring in the latter half of the 20th century had both ecological and economic consequences. We review the effect of the collapse and investigate whether the increased understanding about the biology, ecology, and stock dynamics gained in the past three decades can aid management to prevent further collapses and improve projections of recovery. Recruitment adds the most uncertainty to estimates of future yield and the potential to reach biomass reference points within a specified time-frame. Stock-recruitment relationships must be viewed as being fluid and dependent on ecosystem change. Likewise, predation mortality changes over time. Management aimed at maximum sustainable yield (MSY) fishing mortality targets implies interannual variation in TACs, and variability in supply is therefore unavoidable. Harvest control rules, when adhered to, aid management greatly. We advocate that well-founded science can substantially contribute to management through improved confidence and increased transparency. At present, we cannot predict the effects of collapse or recovery of a single stock on the ecosystem as a whole. Moreover, as managers try to reconcile commitments to single-species MSY targets with the ecosystem-based approach, they must consider the appropriate management objectives for the North Sea ecosystem as a whole.},

The two ITQ fishery management systems studied were implemented in 1990 and are still in the early stages of development: Surf Clam and Ocean Quahog ITQs in the US Extended Economic Zone, and Under 65' Mobile Gear Groundfish ITQs in the Scotia-Fundy region of Atlantic Canada. We note differences and similarities in the two fisheries and factors that precipitated the decision to switch to ITQs, the process itself, the design of the two ITQ systems and some of the consequences. Among the lessons learned from the comparative study are the critical importance of decisions about transferability of quotas and the political and historical context, and pre-existing industry structure, to the acceptance and performance of ITQs. In addition, the research shows mixed results for questions about relationships between exclusive property rights and stewardship, on the one hand, and between individual quota systems and co-management on the other. We consider these and other findings in the light of evaluative criteria such as economic efficiency, social equity and stewardship.},

abstract = {Abstract: The mobility of fish populations is often ignored in population$\backslash$ndynamics models. However, in many cases (with tunas being a prime$\backslash$nexample), movement and spatial heterogeneity may be striking features$\backslash$nof the fish populations and their exploitation. We describe a general$\backslash$nquantitative framework to estimate movement and mortality of fish$\backslash$npopulations from tagging data. Movement is represented by an advection-diffusion$\backslash$nprocess, which is the population equivalent of individual movement$\backslash$nbased on a biased random walk. Finite difference approximations for$\backslash$nsolving the partial differential equation are provided. The model$\backslash$nis parameterized by assuming that movement parameters are homogeneous$\backslash$nwithin specified geographical regions and seasons, that fishing mortality$\backslash$nis proportional to fishing effort, and that natural mortality is$\backslash$nconstant over area and time. All model parameters are estimated simultaneously$\backslash$nby maximum likelihood. The method is illustrated by application to$\backslash$nskipjack tuna (Katsuwonus pelamis) in the western Pacific Ocean.$\backslash$nSkipjack movement is shown to be highly variable at both seasonal$\backslash$nand interannual time scales. Comparison with the results of a spatially$\backslash$naggregated analysis of the same data reveals that the spatial model$\backslash$nprovides a much better fit to the data and, unlike the spatially$\backslash$naggregated model, enables estimation of the natural mortality rate$\backslash$nfree of the effects of movement within the model domain.$\backslash$n$\backslash$n$\backslash$nR�sum� : La mobilit� des populations de poisson est souvent ignor�e$\backslash$ndans les mod�les de dynamique des populations.

A, range of technical$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmodifications of fishing gears aimed at improving their selective$\backslash$n$\backslash$nproperties is available to help achieve these goals, but their$\backslash$n$\backslash$neffectiveness varies. Through three case studies, we describe how$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmanagement controls influence fishing behaviour and the adoption$\backslash$nof$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmore selective gear, and demonstrate how conservation goals can be$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndiscouraged or encouraged by the strategy. in Norway, limits set$\backslash$non the$\backslash$n$\backslash$nmaximum quantity of sublegal fish that may be retained on board,$\backslash$nin$\backslash$n$\backslash$ncombination with a ban on discarding, resulted in substantial area$\backslash$n$\backslash$nclosures in the Barents Sea. Therefore, to gain access, fishers$\backslash$n$\backslash$ndeveloped technical modifications to enhance gear selectivity. in$\backslash$nboth$\backslash$n$\backslash$nshrimp and demersal trawl fisheries, the modifications are now being$\backslash$n$\backslash$nused by virtually the whole fleet.

abstract = {A growing volume of recent research on small-scale fisheries governance has a focus on local perspectives and priorities of small-scale fisherfolk. This paper develops from this local perspective a novel focus on what is a fundamental priority of many small-scale fishers: concerns about inequality. The paper begins with a critical review of the literature on small-scale fisheries governance and suggests how a focus on inequality can make a useful contribution. The paper uses case-studies of small-scale fisheries in Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Philippines to highlight local priorities about inequality and the implications for small-scale fisheries governance. PNG and the Philippines have very different social, political and environmental contexts, yet in both cases, local inequalities were a key pre-occupation of fisherfolk and posed major challenges for fisheries governance. While in both of the case-studies, fishers were aware of and keen to act on resource sustainability, this concern was overridden by concerns over: who obtained benefits from the fishery; who was responsible for resource degradation; and who should bear the costs of regulation. We conclude by discussing how our emphasis on the importance of inequality at a local level can potentially be integrated within many influential approaches to small-scale fisheries governance. {\textcopyright}2013 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd.},

abstract = {Abstract This article builds a theoretical framework to help explain governance patterns in global value chains. It draws on three streams of literature – transaction costs economics, production networks, and technological capability and firm-level learning – to identify three variables that play a large role in determining how global value chains are governed and change. These are: (1) the complexity of transactions, (2) the ability to codify transactions, and (3) the capabilities in the supply-base. The theory generates five types of global value chain governance – hierarchy, captive, relational, modular, and market – which range from high to low levels of explicit coordination and power asymmetry. The article highlights the dynamic and overlapping nature of global value chain governance through four brief industry case studies: bicycles, apparel, horticulture and electronics.},

Typically these have not employed the appropriate frontier estimation techniques. The cost functions usually estimated — such as the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) function — are highly non-linear, and the standard software packages do not allow stochastic frontier estimation in such cases. We derive and maximise the likelihood function associated with this problem, and hence construct measures of economies of scale and scope which obtain in British higher education. We use the half-normal residuals generated by the stochastic frontier estimation to construct measures of technical efficiency for each university in our sample. },

It now seems that the fishing industry is to be entrusted to become exemplary stewards, to become efficient, to maximize resource rent, to stop racing for fish, and to make society better off.

First, the literature was reviewed for existing information, second, interviews were performed of experts from the countries of the case studies. The collected information from the case studies was used to assess the management regime innovations and changes in management costs after the new regimes had been introduced. Findings show that data availability is the big issue in solving the question of how much fisheries management cost in the selected European cases. On the other hand, from the data acquired it became clear that the government spending on fisheries management usually does not depend on the change in fisheries management regime. This was observed in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Spain. Only the Polish case showed that a higher number of technical regulations applied to fisheries led to higher administration and enforcement costs and consequently research costs. This was observed when Poland joined the EU and had to adhere to CFP regulations. It is expected though that enforcement and research costs will decrease in the long run once the innovative regimes, for example participatory governance, are introduced.},

abstract = {The ocean regulates the global climate, provides humans with natural resources such as food, materials, important substances, and energy, and is essential for international trade and recreational and cultural activities. Together with human development and economic growth, free access to, and availability of, ocean resources and services have exerted strong pressure on marine systems, ranging from overfishing, increasing resource extraction, and alteration of coastal zones to various types of thoughtless pollution. Both economic theory and many case studies suggest that there is no “tragedy of the commons” but a “tragedy of open access”. With high likeliness, structures of open access are non-sustainable. International cooperation and effective governance are required to protect the marine environment and promote the sustainable use of marine resources in such a way that due account can be taken of the environmental values of current generations and the needs of future generations. For this purpose, developing and agreeing on one Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) specifically for the Ocean and Coasts could prove to be an essential element. The new SDGs will build upon the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and replace them by 2015. Ensuring environmental sustainability in a general sense is one of the eight MDGs but the ocean is not explicitly addressed. Furthermore, the creation of a comprehensive underlying set of ocean sustainability targets and effective indicators developed within a global Future Ocean Spatial Planning (FOSP) process would help in assessing the current status of marine systems, diagnosing ongoing trends, and providing information for inclusive, forward-looking, and sustainable ocean governance.},

The deployment of these objectives and indicators initially provides a benchmark and, over the life of a management plan, can subsequently be used to identify trends in effects on a variety of social and economic elements that may be objectives in the management of a fishery. It is acknowledged that the degree to which factors can be monitored will be dependent upon resources of management agencies, however these frameworks provide a method for effectively monitoring and measuring change in the social dimension of fisheries management.Essentially, the work discussed in this paper provides fisheries management with the means to both track and begin to understand the effects of government policy and management plans on the social dimension of the fishing industry and its associated communities. Such tools allow the consideration of these elements, within an evidence base, into policy arrangements, and consequently provide an invaluable contribution to the ability to address resilience and sustainability of fishing industries and associated communities.},

It is calibrated over the period 2006-2010 using monthly catch and effort data from the French Guiana's coastal fishery, involving thirteen species and four fleets. Using projections at the horizon 2040, different management strategies and scenarios are compared from a viability viewpoint, thus accounting for biodiversity preservation, fleet profitability and food security.

We find that U.S. productivity growth is slightly higher than average, all of which is due to technical change. Japan's productivity growth is the highest in the sample, with almost half due to efficiency change. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 1994 American Economic Association},

Technical reasons for taking a rather cautious approach to the implementation of ITQs have been provided previously. In the current contribution, I first highlight the strengths and weaknesses of ITQs and then provide suggestions on how to design and implement these quotas to mitigate their weaknesses. ITQs need to be designed carefully as part of a broad ecosystem-based management scheme to meet the three generally accepted objectives of modern fisheries management: ecological, economic, and social sustainability.},

abstract = {This study proposes that Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) practices may influence consumers' pro-social behavior. We propose that this influence depends on the firm's motivation for CSR, and is moderated by the consumer-brand social distance. Two experiments demonstrate that consumers close to a brand become less pro-social when the firm's motivation is perceived as self-serving (vs. public-serving), whereas consumers distant from the brand are equally influenced by the CSR action regardless of the motivation behind it. A mediation analysis supported the hypothesis that this effect occurs because of consumer skepticism about the CSR action. When the firm's motivation is self-serving (vs. public-serving), consumers close to the brand become more skeptical, which decreases their intention to support a social cause. Our results contribute theoretically by showing that the positive and negative effects of CSR practices on consumers' pro-social behavior are moderated by consumer-brand social distance. We also show the mediating role played by consumer skepticism. Moreover, we demonstrate that CSR influences consumer behavior beyond the consumer-brand dyadic relationship.},

abstract = {Many marine fish stocks are overexploited and considerable overcapacity exists in fishing fleets worldwide. One of the reasons for the imbalance between resource availability and fishing capacity is technological development, which continuously increases the efficiency of the vessels—a mechanism referred to as " technological creep. " We review how the introduction of new and more efficient electronic equipment, gear design, engines, deck equipment, and catch-handling procedures influences the capture efficiency (catchability) of commercial fishing vessels. On average, we estimate that catchability increases by 3.2{\%} per year due to technological developments, an increase often ignored in fisheries management. The documentation and quantification of technological creep improves the basis for successfully integrating the effects of technological development (and catchability changes) in fisheries management regulations and policies. Ways of counteracting the undesired effects of technological creep are discussed as are the potential management benefits from improved fishing technology. Specific suggestions are given on the selection, application, and tuning of fisheries management tools that can be used to improve the balance between harvesting capacity and resource availability.},

As the name of the library indicates, the project was born around the Forward Search approach, but it has evolved to include the main traditional robust multivariate and regression techniques, including LMS, LTS, MCD, MVE, MM and S estimation. To address problems where data deviate from typical model assumptions, tools are available for robust data transformation and robust model selection. When different views of the data are available, e.g. a scatterplot of units and a plot of distances of such units from a fitted model, FSDA links such views and offers the possibility to interact with them. For example, selections of objects in a plot are highlighted in the other plots. This considerably simplifies the exploration of the data in view of extracting information and detecting patterns. We show the potential of the FSDA in chemometrics using data from chemical and pharmaceutical problems, where the presence of outliers, multiple groups, deviations from normality and other complex structures is not an exceptional circumstance. ?? 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The results indicate that the number of vessels was reduced by at least 30{\%} within a few years of the implementation of individual vessel quotas. Thereafter a slow reduction in vessel numbers continued, indicating that it may take time period before over-capacity is fully removed. Moreover, the total effect on vessel numbers is surprisingly similar across countries and fisheries despite different degrees of transferability in the different cases analysed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

At the heart of these changes are the so-called Regional Advisory Councils (RACs) and the idea of partially replacing the burden of proof on the resource users (fishing industry). This change entails new forms of interaction between fishers' representatives, other stakeholders (e.g. NGOs), policy-makers and scientists. By drawing on experiences from the Baltic Sea RAC, the analysis focuses on two aspects of fisheries governance: institutional design and the process of negotiation and decision-making. It is concluded that to allow for a partial shift in the burden of proof, stakeholder organisations such as RACs need to adapt both institutionally as well as process-wise to enable a more constructive and responsible fisheries governance system.},

abstract = {Many definitions of the ecosystem approach circulate, the common denominator being the system approach which seeks to take the entirety of a marine ecosystem into consideration. As marine ecosystems cover large geographical areas this approach calls for cooperation between the riparian states. This has being acknowledged in EU policies such as the Marine Strategy Framework Directive and the Marine Spatial Planning Directive. Yet implementing the ecosystem approach in practise runs into some operationalisation issues such as the position of regional cooperation between Member States vis a vis the treaty of the European Union; the positioning of the ecosystem approach between fisheries management and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive; the problem of stakeholder involvement and the balancing of ecological and economic concerns; the tension of the need for relative stability and the introduction of possible new models for organising regional cooperation. These issues appear to be like elephants in the room: obvious issues related to the need for regionalisation which apparently remain undiscussed. In this article, based on analyses within a number of European projects and discussions with relevant actors, the needed discussion on how to organise the management of human activities at the appropriate geo-political level matching the scale of the ecosystem, hence institutionalising marine management at the regional level, is initiated.},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) have reduced overcapacity and increased profitability in many fisheries, and have sometimes helped to reduce overfishing. ITQs are designed almost entirely on the basis of economic theory, however. This paper assesses ITQs from the viewpoints of four broader analytical frameworks: the interactive governance approach (IGA); the social-ecological systems (SES) framework; the ecosystems approach to fisheries (EAF); and the legal and rights-based paradigm. When viewed from these perspectives, ITQs are seen to involve several real and potential problems. These problems include concentration of ownership and the loss of SSFs; failure to make use of non-economic modes of governance; risk of ecological damage and overexploitation, and unfairness to the public as the owner of the fish. Nevertheless, ITQ schemes can be modified in ways that reduce the potential negative impacts while still retaining the structure and economic advantages. This paper describes four possible changes: reserving quota share for traditional fisheries and/or SSFs; explicitly imposing a duty of stewardship on quota holders; implementing fees or royalties rather than granting ITQs for free; and cooperative regulation. For each proposed change, the problems and weaknesses which it addresses are identified, and the potential effectiveness of the solution is discussed.},

abstract = {Pay distributions fan out with experience. The leading explanations for this pattern are that over time, either employers learn about worker productivity but productivity remains fixed or workers' productivities themselves evolve heterogeneously. We propose a dynamic specification that nests both employer learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity. We estimate this model on a 20-year panel of pay and performance measures from a single, large firm. The advantage of these data is that they provide us with repeat measures of productivity, some of which have not yet been observed by the firm when it sets wages. We use our estimates to investigate how learning and dynamic productivity heterogeneity jointly contribute to the increase in pay dispersion with age. We find that both mechanisms are important for understanding wage dynamics. The dispersion of pay increases with experience primarily because productivity differences increase. Imperfect learning, however, means that wages differ significantly from individual productivity all along the life cycle because firms continuously struggle to learn about a moving target in worker productivity. Our estimates allow us to calculate the degree to which imperfect learning introduces a wedge between the private and social incentives to invest in human capital. We find that these disincentives exist throughout the life cycle but increase rapidly after about 15 years of experience. Thus, in contrast to the existing literature on employer learning, we find that imperfect learning might have especially large effects on investments among older workers.},

In this paper, stochastic production frontier analysis is conducted in conjunction with a technical inefficiency model to examine the productive performance and its determinants in carp pond culture in Peninsula Malaysia. The mean technical efficiency for sample carp farms is estimated to be 42{\%}, indicating a great potential for increasing carp production in Peninsula Malaysia through improved efficiency. Seed ratio has a significant effect on fish production; therefore, the proper choice of species composition is important to improving productivity in carp polyculture. Because the intensive/semi-intensive system is found to be technically more efficient than the extensive system, efforts should be made to promote the intensive/semi-intensive carp culture.},

abstract = {As a vital element in developing and maintaining any forms of relationship, consumer trust has attracted increasing attentions from hospitality and tourism researchers since the 1990s. As a fairly new topic, it requires frequent and critical monitoring which would shed light on current research status and make needed adjustments in terms of methodological process and inquiry focus. However, up until now, there has been little systematically review of this body of work. As such, the current study aims to fill this void by conducting a content analysis of publications on consumer trust in the domains of tourism and hospitality since 1998, when the first article on trust was published. Articles were analyzed in terms of conceptualization and operationalization. Findings reveal that research of consumer trust is still at the stage of borrowing constructs from other established disciplines and developing research models to test its compatibility in selected industrial sectors. Theories from social science in general and social exchange theory in particular are used as the underlying theoretical framework. Consumer trust is generally treated as a multidimensional concept and it is measured at individual level. In consistent with how it was conceptualized, consumer trust was commonly examined empirically. Data of consumers' perceptual responses was collected by onsite survey, main survey, or online survey. Also, mixed data-collection techniques were also spotted in the reviewing process. Statistical analysis especially Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was mainly adopted which implies large sample size used in relevant studies. Indeed, qualitative methods like focus group and interviews were also existed, functioning to dig out context-based information of consumer trust in a certain domain. From this perspective, studies reviewed in this study had methodological rigor. Based on the research results, implications and future research directions were suggested.},

abstract = {Public participation is a key ingredient of good governance and there are many advantages of involving stakeholders in the decision-making process. The European Commission identified the lack of stakeholder involvement as one of the major weaknesses of the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). As such, the 2002 Reform of the CFP aimed to improve its system of governance by increasing the involvement of stakeholders in decision-making. Over the last decade, Scottish inshore waters have seen an increase in management measures focused on involving fishers, delegating responsibilities and decentralizing management. The present document investigates commercial inshore fishers' perceptions of participation in the decision-making process and attitudes towards a new management regime - the Inshore Fisheries Groups (IFGs) - which aims to increase participation in and decentralization of inshore fisheries management. A survey was conducted, through face-to-face interviews, and ordered logistic and multiple regression models created to identify which characteristics influence fishers' perceptions and attitudes. The present analysis concluded that, 5 years subsequent to the reform of the CFP, the majority of inshore fishers perceive themselves not to be consulted or involved in the decision-making process. However, and despite the fact that fishers are not completely certain of the potential of the IFGs to increase their participation in the management process, they have an overall positive attitude towards their implementation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Productivity growth in Swedish electricity distribution has been quite substantial for an extended period of time. The main reason for this is economies of density. In terms of the number of customers served, the productivity growth has been negative. Ownership or economic organization does not seem to be related to productivity change in any significant way. The productivity growth in rural areas has been higher than the growth in urban areas. This is probably due to the structural rationalization of rural electricity distribution, whereby many small service areas were merged into larger ones. The results indicate that the primary source of productivity growth is returns to network density, that is, the economies of increasing the amount of electricity supplies when the network is held constant. In his comments, Mork suggests that there may be less to the conclusion that ownership makes no significant difference when it comes to productivity than meets the eye.},

This study employed an ethnographic approach to interview experienced fishermen in Australia (recreational) and the Solomon Islands (subsistence/artisanal) and to provide cross-cultural insight into their behaviour, perceptions and motivations to fish. Although food and income were the most identified motivations by fishers in the Solomon Islands (100{\%} and 93{\%} of fishers, respectively), 75{\%} of motivation categories paralleled those of recreational fishers. Fishermen in the Solomon Islands also expressed an eagerness to actively pursue fishing despite the potential for alternative incomes, possibly reflecting the presence of a recreational mindset. The willingness to continue fishing in the absence of necessity illustrates the potential for growth of recreational fisheries where economic conditions improve. In Australia, connection to the environment was the most common motivation for recreational fishers (96{\%} of fishers). Recreational fishers also perceived that fishing enhanced social capital, promoted respect for nature and provided health and economic benefits. Senior fishers identified young males to be most likely to engage in excessive fishing through displays of machismo, but emphasised the role of fishing in providing a safe environment for youth to vent angst and frustration. These results suggest that fishing activities may deliver fundamental benefits to individuals and societies and that in some regions fishers may be valuable advocates for conservation and social cohesion if their motivations and values are appreciated and channelled appropriately.},

abstract = {BackgroundThe consumption of dietary supplements is highest among athletes and it can represent potential a health risk for consumers.ObjectiveThe aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of consumption of dietary supplements by road runners.MethodsWe interviewed 817 volunteers from four road races in the Brazilian running calendar. The sample consisted of 671 male and 146 female runners with a mean age of 37.9???12.4?years.ResultsOf the sample, 28.33{\%} reported having used some type of dietary supplement. The main motivation for this consumption is to increase in stamina and improve performance. The probability of consuming dietary supplements increased 4.67 times when the runners were guided by coaches. The consumption of supplements was strongly correlated (r?=?0.97) with weekly running distance, and also highly correlated (r?=?0.86) with the number of years the sport had been practiced. The longer the runner had practiced the sport, the higher the training volume and the greater the intake of supplements. The five most frequently cited reasons for consumption were: energy enhancement (29.5{\%}), performance improvement (17.1{\%}), increased level of endurance (10.3{\%}), nutrient replacement (11.1{\%}), and avoidance of fatigue (10.3{\%}). About 30{\%} of the consumers declared more than one reason for taking dietary supplements. The most consumed supplements were: carbohydrates (52.17{\%}), vitamins (28.70{\%}), and proteins (13.48{\%}).ConclusionsSupplement consumption by road runners in Brazil appeared to be guided by the energy boosting properties of the supplement, the influence of coaches, and the experience of the user. The amount of supplement intake seemed to be lower among road runners than for athletes of other sports. We recommend that coaches and nutritionists emphasise that a balanced diet can meet the needs of physically active people.},

We propose a stochastic viability approach to address such problems. We consider a discrete-time control dynamical model with uncertainties, representing a bioeconomic system. The sustainability of this system is described by a set of constraints, defined in practice by indicators - namely, state, control and uncertainty functions - together with thresholds. This approach aims at identifying decision rules such that a set of constraints, representing various objectives, is respected with maximal probability. Under appropriate monotonicity properties of dynamics and constraints, having economic and biological content, we characterize an optimal feedback. The connection is made between this approach and the so-called Management Strategy Evaluation for fisheries.

abstract = {Fisheries management systems around the world are highly diverse in their design, operation, and effectiveness at meeting objectives. A variety of management institutions, strategies, and tactics are used across disparate regions, fishing fleets, and taxonomic groups. At a global level, it is unclear which particular management attributes have greatest influence on the status of fished populations, and also unclear which external factors affect the overall success of fisheries management systems. We used expert surveys to characterize the management systems by species of 28 major fishing nations and examined influences of economic, geographic, and fishery-related factors. A Fisheries Management Index, which integrated research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomic attributes, showed wide variation among countries and was strongly affected by per capita gross domestic product (positively) and capacity-enhancing subsidies (negatively). Among 13 management attributes consid-ered, three were particularly influential in whether stock size and fishing mortality are currently in or trending toward desirable states: extensiveness of stock assessments, strength of fishing pressure limits, and comprehensiveness of enforcement programs. These results support arguments that the key to successful fisheries management is the implementation and enforcement of science-based catch or effort limits, and that monetary investment into fisheries can help achieve management objectives if used to limit fishing pressure rather than enhance fishing capacity. Countries with currently less-effective management systems have the greatest potential for improving long-term stock status outcomes and should be the focus of efforts to improve fisheries management globally. resource management | stock assessment | fisheries enforcement | fishery subsidies | marine conservation S tudies in recent years have yielded divergent views of the status of marine populations and recommendations for how the world's fisheries should best be managed (1–6). Although scientists are generally unanimous in calling for stronger management, some proposed solutions involve widespread establishment of marine reserves (4), whereas others involve greater investment in man-agement structures, such as stock assessments and enforcement of catch or effort limits (6–8), or in reforms of fishing fleets toward rights-based management (1). Fisheries management systems in-volve a wide array of policies and regulations to meet conservation and socioeconomic objectives (5, 9, 10). These aspects vary within and among countries, target species, and fishing fleets. Given the great diversity in fisheries management systems, it has not been clear which specific management characteristics lead to success across systems, but it seems increasingly clear that successful at-tributes involve the capacity to limit fishing pressure (1, 2, 6–8, 11). We used expert surveys to characterize attributes of research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics of fisheries man-agement systems in 28 major fishing countries that collectively ac-count for {\textgreater}80{\%} of global total catch. We specified survey criteria as to whether these attributes play an effective role in limiting fishing pressure for target species. We quantified geographic, economic, and fishery-related influences on the management system, and in turn quantified how management attributes individually affect re-cent status and trends of stock size and fishing mortality. Survey responses from fishery experts showed high variability among 28 countries in research, management, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions of management systems, as well as in stock status (Fig. 1). Values for each dimension are weighted means of several criteria, with answers of 0, 0.5, or 1 reflecting the degree to which a criterion was met for each of 10 species in the country. Survey responses were correlated among research, man-agement, enforcement, and socioeconomics dimensions (r = 0.66– 0.82) (Fig. S1A) and were averaged with equal weighting to obtain a Fisheries Management Index (FMI) for each returned survey (n = 191) (Fig. S2A), which were subsequently aggregated by country. FMI is an indicator of the effectiveness of management systems at meeting objectives. Survey responses were weighted by confidence scores in answers provided for individual questions and self-assigned level of expertise; sensitivity analyses considered alternative weighting schemes. Countries with high FMI values included the United States,},

abstract = {Fisheries management is characterized by multiple and conflicting objectives, multiple stakeholders with divergent interests and high levels of uncertainty about the dynamics of the resources being managed. This conjunction of issues can result in high levels of contention and poor outcomes in the management process. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) can assist in the resolution of these issues. MSE involves assessing the consequences of a range of management options and laying bare the trade-offs in performance across a range of management objectives. Key steps in the approach involve turning broad objectives into specific and quantifiable performance indicators, identifying and incorporating key uncertainties in the evaluation, and communicating the results effectively to client groups and decision-makers. At a technical level, the framework facilitates dealing with multiple objectives and uncertainties in prediction. At the implementation level, it fails if it cannot accommodate effective stakeholder participation and acceptance. MSE shares many features with approaches such as adaptive management and development of management procedures. The principles for implementing the MSE approach are reviewed and practical aspects of its implementation under the Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) partnership model to fisheries management are discussed. The model stresses stakeholder involvement in all key areas of fisheries management, from stock assessment and setting research priorities, to enforcement and decision-making. Stakeholder involvement, including industry, science, and conservation, extends from membership of the AFMA Board, through Management Advisory Committees to Fisheries Assessment Groups. The benefits and limitations of the AFMA partnership approach are reviewed, both for MSE, and, in a wider sense, in the development of an effective fisheries management system.},

abstract = {Two of the primary issues of the next Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform are maximum sustainable yield (MSY) and transferable fishing concessions (TFCs). The European Commission agreed on implementing TFCs under some major principles including reserving a part of total quotas for small-scale fishermen in order to prevent the reduction in the fish catching sector employment. Besides, the European Commission set the goal of achieving MSY for all European fisheries by 2015. The interrelation between these two objectives should be well understood. In this study, the impact of fishing on total biomass is analyzed under an age-structured model, and the potential effects of TFCs on the achievement process of MSY harvesting conditions are explained. It is shown that the implementation of TFCs, under the major principles defined by the European Commission, has an impact on both the total biomass growth and the time path to reach the goal of MSY. The paper concludes that initial allocation of quotas does matter since reserving quotas for small-scale fishermen reduces the time needed to achieve MSY.},

We focus on the formation mechanisms of a consumer's decision in the pre-usage stage, the feedback mechanisms of usage behavior in the usage stage, and the evaluation mechanisms in the post-usage stage. By analyzing longi-tudinal data collected from 332 individuals through two rounds of surveys, we find that pre-use trust has both direct and indirect influences on mobile banking usage behavior. Usage behavior provides significant feedbacks on cognitive or psychological factors, and customers' evaluations have significant impacts on satisfaction. Satisfaction enhances post-use trust, which in turn affects future usage behavior. We also find that pre-use trust has a long term impact on post-use trust. Together, these results illustrate the dynamic process through which m-commerce consumer trust transforms.},

@article{Autor2008,
abstract = {A recent “revisionist” literature characterizes the pronounced rise in U.S. wage inequality since 1980 as an “episodic” event of the first half of the 1980s driven by nonmarket factors (particularly a falling real minimum wage) and concludes that continued increases in wage inequality since the late 1980s substantially reflect the mechanical confounding effects of changes in labor force composition. Analyzing data from the Current Population Survey for 1963 to 2005, we find limited support for these claims. The slowing of the growth of overall wage inequality in the 1990s hides a divergence in the paths of upper-tail (90/50) inequality— which has increased steadily since 1980, even adjusting for changes in labor force composition—and lower-tail (50/10) inequality, which rose sharply in the first half of the 1980s and plateaued or contracted thereafter. Fluctuations in the real minimum wage are not a plausible explanation for these trends since the bulk of inequality growth occurs above the median of the wage distribution. Models emphasizing rapid secular growth in the relative demand for skills—attributable to skill-biased technical change— and a sharp deceleration in the relative supply of college workers in the 1980s do an excellent job of capturing the evolution of the college/high school wage premium over four decades. But these models also imply a puzzling deceleration in relative demand growth for college workers in the early 1990s, also visible in a recent “polarization” of skill demands in which employment has expanded in high-wage and low-wage work at the expense of middle-wage jobs. These patterns are potentially reconciled by a modified version of the skill-biased technical change hypothesis that emphasizes the role of information technology in complementing abstract (high-education) tasks and substituting for routine (middle-education) tasks.},

abstract = {Milkfish has been farmed in Taiwan for over 300 years. Faced with limited land resources, a labor shortage, decreasing demand, and growth of imported fisheries products, the industry is looking at the problem of how to maintain a sustainable and efficient production. This study specifies a stochastic production frontier function to estimate potential milkfish farm output and efficiency by using 1997-1999 data from a survey of 433 aquaculture milkfish farms. Both Translog and Cobb-Douglas frontier production models are estimated using the maximum likelihood estimation method. Empirical results show that the Translog stochastic production function model fits the data better and that milkfish farming in Taiwan exhibits diminishing returns to scale. We also compare estimated maximum potential milkfish production per hectare under various pond conditions to provide managers with information about how to boost efficiency. In addition, this study estimates substitution elasticities and complementarity of input factors for milkfish farms to provide helpful information for milkfish farmers on how to reallocate input resources and help raise milkfish productivity through improvements in technical efficiency. ?? 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Ward2008,
abstract = {Many tools have become available for biologists for evaluating competing ecological models - models may be judged based on the fit to data alone (e.g. likelihood), or more formal statistical criteria may be used. Because of the implied assumptions of each tool, model selection criteria should be chosen a priori for the problem at hand, - a model that is considered 'good' in its explanatory power may not be the best choice for a problem that requires prediction. In this paper, I review the behavior and assumptions of the four most commonly used statistical criteria (Akaike's Information Criterion, AIC; Schwarz or Bayesian Information Criterion, BIC; Deviance Information Criterion, DIC; Bayes factors). Second, I illustrate differences in these model selection tools by applying the four criteria to thousands of simulated abundance trajectories. With the simulation model known, I examine whether each of the criteria are useful in selecting models to evaluate simple questions, such as whether time series support evidence of density dependent population growth. Across simulations, the maximum likelihood criteria consistently favored simpler population models when compared to Bayesian criteria. Among the Bayesian criteria, the Bayes factor favored the correct simulation model more frequently than the Deviance Information Criterion. There was considerable uncertainty in the ability of the Bayes factor to discriminate between models, this tool selected the simulation model slightly more frequently than other approaches. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

But if unit size is reduced, fewer animals will be caught during a survey. Concern has been expressed that this reduction in total catch would lower the precision of estimates of population characteristics, such as age and length frequency distributions, of importance for stock management. In this paper we examine the effect of sampling unit size, intra- cluster correlation, and variable density on the precision of estimates of population characteristics. An examination of some survey data indicates that reducing the size of the sampling unit employed and using the time saved to take samples at more locations could also yield more precise estimates of population parameters.},

This paper analyses how the stakeholders perceive a results-based management system for four fisheries in different European sea-basins as well as at a pan-European level. The results indicate a need for adaptive and participatory management approaches, building on regional adaptations within transparent and plural frameworks for fisheries.

abstract = {The age distribution of a random sample, or the "catch curve" from a stationary animal or fish population, provides information on the annual survival rate of the population. The usual assumptions imply that the age distribution in such a population is geometric. The best (minimum variance unbiased) estimate of the annual survival rate is X̄[1 + X̄ - (1/n)]-1, X̄ being the mean age and n the sample size. This estimate is compared to the so-called "Jackson" estimate and some modifications of Jackson's estimate. Assumptions basic to regression estimates of the survival rate are considered. A test of the model is given for the particular case where it is suspected that there may be selection against younger ages. With the geometric age distribution there is no unbiased estimate of i, the instantaneous mortality rate, but a nearly unbiased estimate is given by i* = ln [1 + X̄ - (1/n)] - ln X̄ - [(n - 1)(n - 2)/n(t + 1)(n + t - 1)] where t = nX̄.},

@article{Fisher2004,
abstract = {The effects of human exploitation on macroecological patterns have received little attention, although such investigations may highlight unique spatial and temporal changes characteristic of species and assemblages subject to persistent disturbance. In unexploited systems (mainly among temperate avifauna) positive relationships between local abundance and geographic distribution are prevalent for individual species through time (intraspecific pattern) and among species during fixed time periods (interspecific pattern). We investigated intraspecific and interspecific relationships for 24 common marine fishes on the Scotian Shelf and Bay of Fundy, Canada, some of which have been commercially exploited for several decades. Based on extensive fisheries-independent trawl survey data from 1970 to 2001, 16 of the 34 stocks, comprising 13 species, exhibited significant positive intraspecific relationships. Significant relationships were associated mainly with those stocks that demonstrated significant temporal trends in both abundance and geographic distribution. The time-averaged (32 yr) interspecific relationship was positive and significant at the largest scale examined. Significant annual interspecific relationships were also detected over 26 yr. Surprisingly, the slopes of the annual relationships increased systematically and doubled through time, probably due to size-selective exploitation, shifting target species, and associated species interactions. In contrast to previous studies, our results indicate that the contributions of individual species to the interspecific relationship can change through time, and these changes dramatically alter the interspecific abundance-distribution relationship. Temporal trends in the interspecific relationship have not previously been reported, and appear to be due to the large spatial- and temporal-scale effects of exploitation.},

In this paper it is argued that many of the usual negative socio-economic consequences of ITQs mentioned in the literature have been largely absent, due to the embeddedness of ITQs in co-management arrangements. However, cracks have appeared lately in this combined management system, allowing an identification of its vulnerabilities. These findings show that the social and economic structure of Dutch fisheries is changing from a rather cooperative to a more competitive and exclusive system, more like conventional ITQs.},

abstract = {Over a period of some 20 years, different aspects of co-management (the sharing of power and responsibility between the government and local resource users) have come to the forefront. The paper focuses on a selection of these: knowledge generation, bridging organizations, social learning, and the emergence of adaptive co-management. Co-management can be considered a knowledge partnership. Different levels of organization, from local to international, have comparative advantages in the generation and mobilization of knowledge acquired at different scales. Bridging organizations provide a forum for the interaction of these different kinds of knowledge, and the coordination of other tasks that enable co-operation: accessing resources, bringing together different actors, building trust, resolving conflict, and networking. Social learning is one of these tasks, essential both for the co-operation of partners and an outcome of the co-operation of partners. It occurs most efficiently through joint problem solving and reflection within learning networks. Through successive rounds of learning and problem solving, learning networks can incorporate new knowledge to deal with problems at increasingly larger scales, with the result that maturing co-management arrangements become adaptive co-management in time. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Section 2 elaborates briefly on the importance to Frisch of the social responsibility of the econometrician. Deeply rooted in Frischian econometrics is the conception that "reality," as represented by statistical data, could not be understood without a theoretical framework and that the foremost theoretical approach is the axiomatic one, as set out in section 3, followed by other innovative theoretical tools, such as strategic types and dynamics, in section 4.

abstract = {The primary indices of abundance for many of the world's most valuable species (e.g. tunas) and vulnerable species (e.g. sharks) are based on catch and effort data collected from commercial and recreational fishers. These indices can, however, be misleading because changes over time in catch rates can occur because of factors other than changes in abundance. Catch-effort standardization is used to attempt to remove the impact of these factors. This paper reviews the current state of the art in the methods for standardizing catch and effort data. It outlines the major estimation approaches being applied, the methods for dealing with zero observations, how to identify and select appropriate explanatory variables, and how standardized catch rate data can be used when conducting stock assessments. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Social mobility presupposes geographical mobility in many rural areas. Migration decisions feature prominently in the lives of rural adolescents, and the viability of local communities often hangs in the balance. As in many other rural areas, the majority of adolescents in Icelandic fishing and farming communities expect to live somewhere else in the future. An analysis of national surveys in 1992 and 2003 reveal that perceptions of occupational opportunities are by far the strongest predictor of migration intentions, and they fully account for gender differences in this regard. Other significant predictors of wanting to stay include being raised in the community, parental support and parental control, and interest in working in the primary industry. Parental education is associated with increased migration intentions, but this effect operates through other factors. In the early 1990s, parental involvement in the primary industry and well-being in school predicted migration intentions, but these issues no longer appeared to be a factor in the early 2000s. Finally, adolescents who identify strongly with the local community and are more proud of their nationality are less likely to expect to migrate. These results are discussed in the context of changing social identities in an increasingly global culture. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {This paper revisits topics addressed in two previous papers on data weighting in fisheries stock assessment models: the first was general (Francis, 2011; Can. J. Fish. Aquat. Sci. 68, 1124–1138); the second considered the related problem of finding the best likelihood for composition data (Francis, 2014; Fish. Res. 151, 70–84). In the light of subsequent literature and experience, four topics seemed in need of increased emphasis or elaboration. (1) For composition data, it is better to think in terms of “right-weighting” (i.e., weighting that is statistically appropriate) than “down-weighting”. (2) The sensitivity of some assessments to changes in weighting can sometimes be reduced by restructuring to reduce model misspecification; this is a good idea, but should be seen as complementary to data weighting, rather than an alternative to it. (3) It seems typical that more than half of the variance of composition residuals arises from process error (arising from model misspecification) rather than observation error. (4) Changing the likelihood for composition data from the multinomial to the Dirichlet-multinomial has some advantages but is not without problems. Some new topics are discussed: most iterative reweighting of composition data is multiplicative, but additive methods deserve consideration; data weighting is more complicated in state-space models; catch data should not be subject to data weighting; there are significant disadvantages in structuring age-related observations of fishery and survey catches as frequencies, rather than compositions (i.e., as numbers, rather than proportions); methods of weighting three additional data types (conditional age at length, tagging abundance; and tagging length-increment) are described.},

By analysing the reform of the CFP by means of the ecosystem-based management framework, we conclude that there is a lack of instruments to deal with the social sustainability objective while economic and ecological sustainability could be simultaneously achieved with the specific measures considered in the reform. Individually analysed, the specific measures could further benefit ecosystem-based management implementation, although not all the observed or analysed consequences of the implementation of these measures move in this direction. In that sense we conclude that the success of the ecosystem based management of EU fisheries depends much more on the specific implementation of the measures and on the accompanying incentives, which in the end, implies that the institutional and political settings will determine its success.},

The responses of fish populations to variability in the marine environment have implications for decision making processes associated with resource management. There is still considerable uncertainty in estimating the responses of tuna populations to short-to-medium-term variability and longer-term change in the oceanic environment. A workshop was organised to examine how advances in oceanography, fisheries science and fisheries economics could be applied to the tuna fisheries of the WCPO and in doing so identify research priorities to improve understanding relevant to progressing management. Research priorities identified included: (i) improved parameterisation of end to end ecosystem model components, processes and feedbacks through expanded biological observations and incorporation of higher resolution climate models; (ii) development of seasonal and inter-annual forecasting tools enabling management responses to short-term variability in tuna distributions and abundances; (iii) improved understanding of the population dynamics of and the energy transfer efficiencies between food web components; (iv) assessment of the optimal value of access rights and overall fishery value under multiple scenarios of tuna distribution and abundance and influences on decision making by fisheries managers and fleets and (v) development of management strategy evaluation frameworks for utilisation in the implementing and testing of fishery management procedures and to help prioritise research directions and investment. Issues discussed and research priorities identified during the workshop have synergies with other internationally managed fisheries and therefore are applicable to many other fisheries.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND
Agri-food is one of the most important sectors of the industry in Europe and potentially a major contributor to the global warming. Sustainability issues in this context pose a huge challenge for several reasons: the variety of considered scales, the number of disciplines involved, the uncertainties, the out-of-equilibrium states, the complex quantitative and qualitative factors, the normative issues and the availability of data. Although important insight and breakthroughs have been attained in different scientific domains, an overarching and integrated analysis of these complex problems have yet to be realized. 

SCOPE AND APPROACH
This context creates huge opportunities for research in interaction with mathematical programming, integrative models and decision-support tools. The paper propose a computational viewpoint including questions of holistic approach, multiscale reconstruction and optimization. Some directions are discussed. 

KEY FINDINGS AND CONCLUSIONS
Several research questions based on a mathematical programming framework are emerging: how can such a framework manage uncertainty, cope with complex qualitative and quantitative information essential for social and environmental considerations, encompass diverse scales in space and time, cope with a multivariable dynamic environment and with scarcity of data. Moreover, how can it deal with different perspectives, types of models, research goals and data produced by conceptually disjoint scientific disciplines, ranging from physics and physiology to sociology and ethics? Building models is essential, but highly difficult; it will need a strong iterative interaction combining computational intensive methods, formal reasoning and the experts of the different fields. Some future research directions are proposed, involving all those dimensions: mathematical resilience, human-machine interactive learning and optimization techniques.},

In this study of the Beijing middle school open enrollment program, we estimate the degree to which children's school outcomes were negatively affected by the poor choices their parents made during the school selection process. We do this by examining parents' responses to a survey on school choices combined with actual school applications, school admission records, and High School Entrance Examination test scores for 4717 students entering middle schools in Beijing via randomized lotteries. We find that the children of parents who made judgment errors in school selection were admitted to lower quality schools and achieved lower test scores on the High School Entrance Examination. Parents who had less education, whose children performed at lower levels in primary school, and who were less attentive to teachers' opinions about schools were more prone to make these errors. Providing assistance to parents, especially those less prepared to make informed choices about school selection, is consequently important for supporting more efficient and equitable open enrollment programs.},

Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) was used to estimate efficiency measures of sample farms. The mean technical, allocative and cost efficiencies for trout farms were measured to be 0.82, 0.83 and 0.68, respectively. Efficiency analysis revealed that inefficient farms would have needed to lower feed and labour costs by 32{\%} to perform as well as other similar, best practice farms in the sample. The decomposition of the technical efficiency measure showed that pure technical inefficiency was the primary cause of technical inefficiency. Research results also suggested that there were positive relationships between cost efficiency and pond tenure, farm ownership, experience of the operators, education level of the operators, contact with extension services, off-farm income and credit availability. Feeding intensity, pond size, and capital intensity had negative effects on cost efficiency. Supplying complete technical packages (feed, credit, etc.) for trout farms may stimulate the adoption of improved technologies. Focusing on trout diseases, water quality, feed production and marketing efficiency in farmers training and extension programs may also help to increase economic efficiency in the research area. {\textcopyright}2005 Elsevier B.V.

Recently, however, the economic competitiveness of Japanese fisheries in the international market is being questioned. In this paper, a detailed examination of the pros and cons of the current system in Japan is compared to the current fishery management measures of Iceland and the United States, where attaining economically or biologically efficient outcomes may be prioritized in making fisheries management decisions. For many coastal fisheries in Japan, maintaining a management scheme in which stakeholders play an active role in determining fisheries measures seems more relevant if their priority is to maintain the stability of coastal communities and equity of stakeholders. Intensive dialog among stakeholders would be necessary to identify shared objectives of their fishery operations and to make decisions to establish specific steps toward the goal of increasing economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, or stability of communities and equity of stakeholders. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Australia has developed a Harvest Strategy Policy (HSP) for Commonwealth fisheries. A harvest strategy specifies the management actions necessary to achieve defined resource objectives in a given fishery, resulting in a formal and proactive management approach that is transparent to all stakeholders. The objectives of the HSP are defined in terms of target and limit biomass reference points, although proxies can be used. It is a significant challenge, therefore, to develop harvest strategies for most small fisheries, which are typically data-poor, have only basic or no formal stock assessments, and have low Gross Value of Production (GVP). For the small Commonwealth fisheries, even indirect biomass estimates are unavailable and, due to their low GVP, it is unlikely that relevant research will be undertaken to determine reliable biomass estimates in the foreseeable future. This paper provides insight into developing harvest strategy frameworks that reconcile the reality and limitations of small fisheries with the intent of the HSP: to cease or avoid overfishing, to rebuild overfished stocks, and to maintain stocks at levels corresponding to the maximum economic yield. The process of harvest strategy development is evaluated and general principles for the pragmatic development and implementation of harvest strategies for small, low-value, data-poor fisheries are considered. These general principles include (i) the development of sets of triggers with conservative response levels, with progressively higher data and analysis requirements at higher response levels, (ii) identifying data gathering protocols and subsequent simple analyses to better assess the fishery, (iii) archiving biological data for possible future analysis, and (iv) the use of spatial management, either as the main aspect of the harvest strategy or an augmentation with other measures. The value of an iterative approach involving stakeholders and managers is emphasized. The above principles are illustrated by three case studies from Australia's small Commonwealth fisheries: the Western Deepwater and North West Slope Trawl Fisheries, the Coral Sea Fishery, and the Bass Strait Central Zone Scallop Fishery.

abstract = {While international agreements and legislation call for incorporation of four pillars of sustainability, the social (including cultural), economic and institutional aspects (the ‘human dimension') have been relatively neglected to date. Three key impediments have been identified: a relative lack of explicit social, economic and institutional objectives; a general lack of process (frameworks, governance) for routine integration of all four pillars of sustainability; and a bias towards biological considerations. Practical integration requires a ‘systems' approach with explicit consideration of strategic and operational aspects of management; multidisciplinary or transdisciplinary evaluations; practical objectives for the four pillars of sustainability; appropriate participation; and a governance system that is able to integrate these diverse considerations in management. We challenge all involved in fisheries to immediately take five practical steps toward integrating ecological, economic, social and institutional aspects: (1) Adopt the perspective of the fishery as a ‘system' with interacting natural, human and management elements; (2) Be aware of both strategic and operational aspects of fisheries assessment and management; (3) Articulate overarching objectives that incorporate all four pillars of sustainability; (4) Encourage appropriate (and diverse) disciplinary participation in all aspects of research, evaluation and management; and (5) Encourage development of (or emulate) participatory governance.},

abstract = {Ecosystem-orientated thinking is increasingly incorporated into fishery management. Given the complexity of ecosystem processes, there is a need to evaluate the tools used to steer this thinking critically. ECOPATH with ECOSIM (EwE), an aggregate system-modelling package, is currently the most widely employed approach to assess the ecosystem effects of fishing. The basic equations and assumptions, strengths and weaknesses, and the potential of this approach to contribute to practical fisheries management advice are reviewed. Strengths include the structured parameterization framework, the inclusion of a well-balanced level of conceptual realism, a novel representation of predator-prey interaction terms, and the inclusion of a Bayes-like approach (ECORANGER) to take account of the uncertainty associated with values for model inputs. Weaknesses in model structure include the constraining nature of the mass-balance assumption (of ECOPATH) for initiating projections, the question- able handling of life history responses such as compensatory changes in the natural mortality rates of marine mammals, overcompensatory stock-recruit relationships that result from default parameter settings, possible problems in extrapolating from the microscale to the macroscale, as well as some (not too far-reaching) mathe- matical inconsistencies in the underlying equations. There is a paucity of systematic and stepwise investigations into model behaviour and properties, and users are cautioned against non-critical use of the default settings. An important limitation related to the predominant use of EwE as a “black-box” modelling tool is that some users fail to consider a range of alternative interaction representations. As with all multispecies approaches, the major limitation in applying the EwE approach lies in the quality and quantity of available data. Current EwE applications generally do not adequately address uncertainty in data inputs and model structure. Prudent EwE applications that utilize good data and are based upon rigorous statistical analyses can complement the quantitative predictions of traditional single-species models. They could be particularly useful in some contexts if output in the form of probability distributions encompassing a range of likely ecosystem responses were to be coupled with attempts to extend Operational Management Procedure (OMP) approaches to fisheries management beyond the single- species level. In particular, such applications could serve as the operating models of the underlying dynamics that are used for computer simulation testing of OMPs},

However, there is a challenge associated with the application of MPAs in marine resource management with respect to the consequences to traditional systems of monitoring and managing fisheries resources. The place-based paradigm of MPAs can complicate the population-based paradigm of most fisheries stock assessments. In this review, we identify the potential complica- tions that could result from both existing and future MPAs to the science and management systems currently in place for meeting conventional fisheries manage- ment objectives. The intent is not to evaluate the effects of implementing MPAs on fisheries yields, or even to consider the extent to which MPAs may achieve conservation oriented objectives, but rather to evaluate the consequences of MPA implementation on the ability to monitor and assess fishery resources consistent with existing methods and legislative mandates. Although examples are drawn primarily from groundfish fisheries on the West Coast of the USA, the lessons are broadly applicable to management systems worldwide, particularly those in which there exists the institutional infrastructure for managing resources based on quantitative assessments of resource status and productivity.},

The disaggregation throws new light on the role of cost factors in explaining the expansion of educational services. High school spending is shown to be highly inelastic to county revenue and major cost factors. The spending decision is analyzed as an example of the common pool problem in distributive politics. Schools offer benefits to each municipality, and municipalities fight for new schools since the costs are shared. The political decision implies a balancing between this spending pressure and the coordinated interests of the county. Political strength, measured by the party fragmentation of the council, is shown to hold down costs and allow for more student enrollment. On the other hand, the spending pressure measured by the average size of the municipalities in the county, influences all three spending components, and the effects depend on the political strength.},

The model describes the equilibrium that results when effort responds to open access incentives and when regulators respond to effort growth by mitigating its potential harmful effects on biomass safety. We use numerical simulations to demonstrate a mechanism by which market growth leads to the diversion of raw inputs into the inherently inferior market. The result is a scenario in which rents are dissipated not only because excessive inputs raise costs, but also because inferior product types reduce revenues. We conclude with an illustrative decomposition of rent gains into revenue and cost savings gains from rationalizing a hypothetical fishery, demonstrating the potential significance of market-side rents.},

abstract = {Awareness of the limitations of a single-species approach to fisheries management has led to global acceptance of the need to adopt a wider ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF) assessment and management. Applying EAF in management requires the application of scientific methods and tools that also go beyond the single-species approaches which used to be, to a large extent, the exclusive sources of scientific advice. Managers and decision-makers must now find management solutions that take into account the wider range of societal objectives that must be explicitly considered under EAF and the interactions in the ecosystem. Ecosystem models, i.e. models that represent a wider range of technological and ecological processes affecting the species in the ecosystem (including multispecies and whole ecosystem models), are potentially important tools for providing this wider scientific information. There are many different types of ecosystem models and they can vary enormously in terms of complexity. They can be used in different ways, ranging from contributing to conceptual understanding, providing information for strategic decisions through to making tactical decisions, although they are rarely used as yet for the last purpose. These guidelines were developed by a group of leading practioners in aquatic ecosystem modelling as a tool for provision of management advice. They are intended to assist users in the construction and application of ecosystem models for EAF. The guidelines address all steps of the modelling process, encompassing scoping and specifying the model, implementation, evaluation and advice on how to present and use the outputs. The overall goal of the guidelines is to assist in ensuring that the best possible information and advice is generated from ecosystem models and used wisely in management. The considerable uncertainties in the predictions provided by ecosystem/multispecies models notwithstanding, decisions have to be made and actions implemented to ensure sustainable and optimal utilization of marine living resources. These decisions must be informed by the best available scientific advice and, in the context of EAF, this scientific advice must include ecosystem considerations. Ecosystem models, adhering as far as possible to the best practices described here, will frequently be the best sources of such information and can lead to advice that rests on explicit and principled arguments. In their absence, managers and decision-makers will have no choice but to fall back on their own mental models which may frequently be subjective, untested and incomplete, a situation which clearly needs to be avoided. Ecosystem models are not at the stage where a single such model could be selected as a “management” model and reliably used at the tactical level to provide management recommendations in a particular case. However, the use for this purpose of simple models with an ecosystem foundation could become more widespread in the near future. Such a foundation would be provided by evaluating these simpler “management” models using Management Strategy Evaluation (MSE), where the operating models reflecting alternative possible underlying dynamics that are used in this evaluation process would include a range of ecosystem models.},

abstract = {The paper studies how a person's concern for a future career may influence his or her incen- tives to put in effort or make decisions on the job. In the model, the person's productive abilities are revealed over time through observations of performance. There are no explicit output-contingent contracts, but since the wage in each period is based on expected output and expected output depends on assessed ability, an "implicit contract" links today's performance to future wages. An incentive problem arises from the person's ability and desire to influence the learning process, and therefore the wage process, by taking unobserved actions that affect today's performance. The fundamental incongruity in preferences is between the individual's concern for human capital returns and the firm's concern for financial returns. The two need be only weakly related. It is shown that career motives can be beneficial as well as detrimental, depending on how well the two kinds of capital returns are aligned.},

abstract = {Capacity reduction programmes, in the form of buybacks or decommissioning, have had relatively widespread application in fisheries in the US, Europe and Australia. A common criticism of such programmes is that they remove the least efficient vessels first, resulting in an increase in average efficiency of the remaining fleet, which tends to increase the effective fishing power of the remaining fleet. In this paper, the effects of a buyback programme on average technical efficiency in Australia's Northern Prawn Fishery are examined using a multi-output production function approach with an explicit inefficiency model. As expected, the results indicate that average efficiency of the remaining vessels was generally greater than that of the removed vessels. Further, there was some evidence of an increase in average scale efficiency in the fleet as the remaining vessels were closer, on average, to the optimal scale. Key factors affecting technical efficiency included company structure and the number of vessels fishing. In regard to fleet size, our model suggests positive externalities associated with more boats fishing at any point in time (due to information sharing and reduced search costs), but also negative externalities due to crowding, with the latter effect dominating the former. Hence, the buyback resulted in a net increase in the individual efficiency of the remaining vessels due to reduced crowding, as well as raising average efficiency through removal of less efficient vessels.},

Ecosystem structure in the Iceland Sea and recent changes to the capelin (Mallotus villosus) population. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: .
The objective of the Iceland Sea Ecosystem Project was to analyse principal ecosystem patterns, including the life history of capelin. Ten surveys were conducted for this purpose between 2006 and 2008, and hydrographic data from 1970 to 2011 were analysed. Long-term temporal patterns indicate an increase in the temperature of surface and intermediate waters during recent years in the Iceland Sea. The phytoplankton consisted mainly of diatoms in spring, with flagellates and dinoflagellates appearing later in the year. Zooplankton and fish were dominated by a few species. In late summer, the pelagic foodweb ranged between trophic levels 2.4 and 3.6. Trends in nutrients and primary production showed a clear seasonal pattern with a spring bloom in late May, followed by a peak in secondary production in July/August. The spatial structure of the lower ecosystem levels in summer was stable across the 3 years, determined mainly by the structure of the water masses. The pelagic fish fauna consisted primarily of adult pelagic fish and transient numbers of larval species. The spatial pattern of capelin indicated northward displacement of 0-group capelin and westward displacement of older capelin in recent years. The annual biomass was estimated at 3.8 million tonnes of phytoplankton, ∼21 million tonnes of zooplankton, and 1.0 million tonnes of fish.},

We introduce the Fishery Performance Indicators (FPIs), a broadly applicable and flexible tool for assessing performance in individual fisheries, and for establishing cross-sectional links between enabling conditions, management strategies and triple bottom line outcomes. Conceptually separating measures of performance, the FPIs use 68 individual outcome metrics--coded on a 1 to 5 scale based on expert assessment to facilitate application to data poor fisheries and sectors--that can be partitioned into sector-based or triple-bottom-line sustainability-based interpretative indicators. Variation among outcomes is explained with 54 similarly structured metrics of inputs, management approaches and enabling conditions. Using 61 initial fishery case studies drawn from industrial and developing countries around the world, we demonstrate the inferential importance of tracking economic and community outcomes, in addition to resource status.},

So how has the EU's Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) fared in trying to achieve this objective? The development of the status of 41 commercially exploited fish stocks from the North East Atlantic, North Sea and Baltic Sea (FAO Area 27) was analysed together with the economic performance of the fleets exploiting those stocks. The analyses indicate that the exploitation status for many of the stocks has greatly improved during the last 10 years while the economic performance of the fleets over the same period has been highly variable. The main economic indicators (gross value added (GVA) and operating cash flow (OCF)) have gradually improved at a time when the general economic situation, which has a great influence on the markets, costs and purchase power, has worsened. While recognizing that much remains to be done to achieve the objective of the WSSD, the analyses indicate that actions implemented in the last decade under the CFP have led to an improvement in the status of many commercially important fish stocks and their fleets towards levels that are closer to those producing MSY.},

This is primarily a consequence of state and national environmental and energy policy actions, and secondarily a result of shifts in economic structure and increases in natural gas supplies. To assess future opportunities of proactive approaches to policy and invest-ment, we analyze 20 sector-based actions at the national and subnational levels in the US that can narrow remaining national carbon emissions gaps by 2020 and beyond, while improving economic and energy efficiency in every sector. These actions are found to provide favorable returns on in-vestment for job creation, energy and cost savings, and multiple measures of energy security. Se-lection and design of these new actions are based on evaluation of hundreds of policy options de-rived from facilitated, stakeholder and consensus-based development of comprehensive climate action planning in 20 states. They represent top issues of focus for policymakers, and serve as key drivers for new investment, collaboration, and governance approaches that are needed to inte-grate economic, energy, and environmental security in the US. This same general approach to planning and analysis is of value to other nations seeking similar benefits. Techniques for com-prehensive, multi-objective, fully integrated, and collaborative systems of planning and analysis are important as a means for comprehensive security solutions.

Sea surface temperature, intense easterly winds, and discharges fromthe Guadalquivir River have been identified as key factors determining early life stage mortality in this anchovy stock.We have constructed an environment-based recruitment model that simulates the abundance of juveniles under alternative parameters representing plausible biological hypotheses.We are able to evaluate howmodelling environment-based recruitment can affect stock assess- ment and how responding to environmental information can benefit fishery management to allow greater average catch levels through the application of harvest control rules (HCRs) based on environmental conditions. While the environment-based rules generally increase allowable catch levels the variance in catch levels also increases, detracting from the improved value based only on average yield. In addition to changes in revenue, the probability of stock collapse is also reduced by using environmental factors in HCRs. To assess the value of these management systemswe simulate a notional insurance scheme, which applies a value to both average yields and uncertainty. The value ofthe information-driven rules can be determined by comparing the relevant premiums payable for equal levels of insurance cover on revenue within each specific management regime. We demonstrate the net value of incorporating environmental factors in the management of anchovies in the Gulf of Ca´diz despite the increased variability in revenue. This could be an effective method to describe outcomes for both commercial fisheries and ecosystem management policies, and as a guide to management of other species whose dynamics are predictable based on in-season observations.},

Owners were participants in Scottish fisheries which were subject to stock recovery measures. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 39 vessel owners during and following a vessel buy-back scheme. The analysis identifies several key factors affecting the decision to keep or dispose of a vessel in the context of a scrapping scheme. These are grouped into factors relating to owner and vessel characteristics, industry and market factors and preferences and expectations of owners. Owners expecting profitable operation considered how to use government grants to enable fresh investment in the fishery. For vessels with poor expected performance, owners' principal concern in considering whether to dispose of a vessel was “will I clear my feet? ” i.e. would the owner be clear of debt if he disposed of the vessel? Despite wanting to exit, if they could not get clear of debt by disposing of the vessel, owners suggested they might continue to operate unprofitable or low profit boats in anticipation of possible improved fishing opportunities arising from the next quota allocation.},

Different modifications result in different changes in the set of environmental impacts, and imply different sets of costs and benefits for different stakeholder groups. In this study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is used to quantify the relative importance of the environmental impacts of fishing to different stakeholder groups. Forty eight individuals representing six different stakeholder groups (ecologists, biologists, economists, gear tech-nologists, fishers and fisheries managers) were surveyed. As expected, fishers and gear technologists placed substantially greater importance on reducing discarding of commercial fish species than on habitat damage. Priorities of other stakeholder groups varied, but all placed greater priority on habitats than the commercial sector. The results suggest that management aimed at reducing environmental impacts of fishing broader than just discarding is appropriate, but such moves are likely to be opposed by the fishing industry. The derived weights also have a direct application to fisheries management, as they allow otherwise non-commensurate impacts to be aggregated into an overall impact to compare envi-ronmental benefits from alternative modifications of fishing gear.},

We flesh out this puzzle by describing the political economy of past and present institutional changes in North America such as bans on fish traps, limited-entry regulations, and individual transferable quotas (ITQs). Our review identifies patterns of distri-butional concerns surrounding property rights; many of the same groups that opposed limits on entry and fish traps also oppose ITQs. We provide examples of how political opposition to ITQs is mollified by modifications in program design, although these design compro-mises may have efficiency costs.

abstract = {Decisions concerning the management of fisheries are founded on confidence statements for interest parameters such as biomass and exploitation rate, derived from complex structural models that describe the dynamics of fisheries. We identify four generic statistical issues and focus on how they impact on the reliability of those confidence statements: (a) parameters for which the data have little or no information; (b) competing structural relationships; (c) weighting of observations; and (d) alternative methods for computing confidence statements. Our purpose is to give an exposition of how these issues impact on fisheries' analyses, with the intent of stimulating thought on more effective alternatives. We describe the fisheries' management context and use two specific studies to illustrate how these generic statistical issues impact on fisheries assessment results. It is demonstrated that these statistical issues can have a profound impact on fishery management decisions and that established approaches to handle them have not been fully developed.},

Elinor Ostrom pursues a third approach, which is based on case studies of existing communities that have established successful and durable systems of managing common property resources.

In particular, experience from NZ could help to alleviate bottlenecks arising from inadequate institutional governance apparatus and barriers to acquisition and application of relevant knowledge. The short pathways, fewer people and simplicity of a unilateral decision-making process make NZ a good place to learn about inclusive governance of fisheries. The detail of why, where and how industry stakeholders get involved in research and management is shaped by the legislative framework, the structures that support it, the people, and how they organise their involvement. Specific examples are used to illustrate four ways in which Europe could apply experience from NZ to enhance the inclusivity of industry stakeholders the evidence-management system required to implement the ecosystem approach to fisheries: (i) Defined 'rules' of engagement, (ii) MoU's to promote a shared vision and the planning to achieve it, (iii) Extended peer review process (iv) Inclusion of research knowledge from industry and science-industry partnerships.},

Multiple competing models were fitted that differed in movement, re- capture rates, and observation error using deviance information criterion. The median annual survival probability in the se- lected model was 0.996 (95{\%} central probability interval (CrI): 0.984, 0.999), which is among the highest reported for this species. Movement among areas was temporally dynamic, although whales exhibited high area fidelity (probability of return- ing to same area of ≥0.75) throughout the study. Median abundance was 1585 whales in 2008 (95{\%} CrI: 1455, 1644). In- corporating an abundance estimate of 393 (95{\%} confidence interval: 331, 455) whales from 1986, the median rate of increase was 5.1{\%} (95{\%} CrI: 4.4{\%}, 5.9{\%}). Although applied here to cetaceans in SEAK, the framework provides a flexible approach for estimating mortality and movement in populations that move among sampling areas.},

abstract = {The study examines economic efficiency of aquaculture production in Edo State. The data for the analysis were obtained from the fish farmers through the administration of structured questionnaire, using multistage sampling technique and leading to the selection of 100 respondents. Data were analyzed, using stochastic frontier production function as in Frontier Version 4.1, applying the maximum likelihood estimation technique. The result of the analysis shows that the fish farmers were operating at the positive increasing returns to scale (RTS = 2.055). The study shows that if the amount of fingerlings, hired labour, family labour, quantity of feeds and annual cost of materials were increased by 100{\%} in aquaculture production, total fish output in the aquaculture farms will increase by 40.2{\%}, 136.9{\%}, 6.5{\%}, 26.5{\%}, and 7.6{\%} for each of the increase in the input respectively.. This establishes the fact that these resources were under utilized in aquaculture production in Edo State. The mean technical efficiency estimated at about 63{\%} is suggesting that the aquaculture farmers were only 63{\%} efficient in the use of the combination of their inputs. The study concludes that aquaculture production and its efficiency can be increased in Edo State in Nigeria by increasing the stocking density, increase access to credit and extension services. If these are done, the contribution of aquaculture fishery to total fish supply in Nigeria that was about 5{\%} in 1991, and then increased to 12{\%} in 2007, can increase faster to about 40{\%} in the nearest future.},

abstract = {A modified DeLury method to estimate fish population size from relative abundance data was developed. The method may be applied either with or without knowledge of the age composition of catch. In addition to estimating catchability coefficients, the technique accounts for error in the measurement of relative abundance. A general-purpose nonlinear regression subroutine was used to fit the model. The technique is demonstrated using Northeast Fisheries Center bottom trawl suwey data as a masure of relative abundance. Fitting was carried out for four fish populations: Georges Bank and Southern New England yellowtail flounder (LimaPulaz femuginea); Georges Bank and NAFO SA 4X haddock (Melanograzmrnus wegkegineks). Catchability coefficients calculated in this manner are con- sistent with prior estimates. In addition, the technique smooths the survey data by fil- tering measurement error from true fluctuations in population size. Population size estimates for haddock derived by ahis method agree closely with virtual population analysis (VPA) For personal use only. estimates.},

The model involves five exploiters; Norway, Iceland, the Faroe Islands, the EU, and Russia and an explicit, stochastic migratory behavior of the stock. Under these conditions Markov Perfect (Nash) equilibrium game strategies are calculated and compared to the jointly optimal exploitation pattern. Not surprisingly, it turns out that the solution to the competitive game is hugely inefficient, leading very quickly to the virtual exhaustion of the resource. The scope for cooperative agreements involving the calculation of Shapley values is investigated. Although the grand coalition of all players maximizes overall benefits, such a coalition can hardly be stable over time un- less side payments are possible},

Secondly, the qualitative part of the study consists of personal interviews of surveyed Finnish fishermen of herring. We find that current management of the Finnish herring fishery is far from being biologically and economically sound. Economic recommendations presented here are more conservative than the biological recommendations provided by the International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES). According to simulation results, an ITQ system is a viable alternative to the current total allowable catch-based management. The results of the interviews show that an ITQ system would likely be supported by the fishermen.},

abstract = {Management of straddling fish stocks has been noted for its political complexity. Negotiations frequently falter as each party seeks to focus upon their own individual and shorter-term goals than the collective interest of the sector. Entrenched positions are often only deepened as new entrants participate to establish their own claims to any emergent share of resource. Unsurprisingly, deadlocks are common and typically compromises are reached only after the real period of biological then economic crisis has passed. Examples to illustrate this tendency can be found in most of the world's oceans and is writ large within the current impasse over blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou) in the North Atlantic. The development of this fishery is discussed and it is shown that despite the scope to add value to the resource base through a pattern of exploitation focussed more upon human consumption than fish meal and oil, there seems little incentive to extricate participants from the cycle of demise that has engulfed negotiations so far. In an at tempt to consider how such seemingly intractable problems might be resolved, attention is next turned to the construction of a new model for resource management specifically intended to contend with the problems thrown up by straddling stocks. Central to this is the need to ensure motivation and incentivisation of value chain members in both national economic zones and international waters. It is proposed that a Multinational Resource Cooperative (MRC) is established and would be the key element in the management model. The MRC, on behalf of the national stakeholders, would auction quota so that fish enterprises can purchase quota units defined in terms of species, quantity, catch area and the time of catch. The MRC would also be financed through a quota auction fee as explained below and arrange its own quota control and enforcement services. By auctioning rights to stakeholders the MRC will enable control and enforcement of the TAC; allocations of fair national shares of resource and critically, motivate fish enterprises to devise and implement market-oriented value adding strategies. Adoption of such a scheme should result in a more efficient use of the remaining straddling stocks whilst there is still time to do so. Importantly, the proposed rent distribution mechanism would also shift the focus of negotiations from being dominated by quotas and access rights to more evident pecuniary metrics. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

These metrics provide an initial data set for descriptive analyses of fishing community status and for exploratory analyses to identify hypotheses for subsequent in-depth study of the socioecological dynamics of Alaskan fishing communities. Metrics were derived by collating information from publicly available databases and include information on fishing portfolios, fishing revenues, fishermen demographics, and fleet characteristics. As demonstration of the community metrics, we examine metric trends in detail for three communities (Kodiak, Sitka, and Togiak), and provide state-wide temporal and spatial assessments to characterize historical dynamics of Alaska's fishing communities. Statewide assessments show synchrony in the dynamics of some metrics, such as increasing population, declining permit ownership, and improving per-fishermen gross revenues, but show considerable variation amongst communities for other metrics, such as the diversification of communities' fishing portfolios and investments into fleets. Spatial distributions of metrics suggest the western and northern parts of Alaska have experienced greater declines in metrics associated with commercial fisheries importance and performance relative to the southern and eastern regions. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t Harvest control rules (HCRs) have been implemented for many fisheries worldwide. However, in most instances, those HCRs are not based on the explicit feedbacks between stock properties and economic considerations. This paper develops a bio-economic model that evaluates the HCR adopted in 2004 by the Joint Norwegian–Russian Fishery Commission to manage the world's largest cod stock, Northeast Arctic cod (NEA). The model considered here is biologically and economically detailed, and is the first to compare the performance of the stock's current HCR with that of alternative HCRs derived with optimality criteria. In particular, HCRs are optimized for economic objectives including fleet profits, economic welfare, and total yield and the emerging properties are analyzed. The performance of these optimal HCRs was compared with the currently used HCR. This paper show that the current HCR does in fact comes very close to maximizing profits. Furthermore, the results reveal that the HCR that maximizes profits is the most precautionary one among the considered HCRs. Finally, the HCR that maximizes yield leads to un-precautionary low levels of biomass. In these ways, the implementation of the HCR for NEA cod can be viewed as a success story that may provide valuable lessons for other fisheries.},

abstract = {This paper aims to examine the levels and determinants of technical efficiency in carp pond culture in India. The stochastic production frontier technique involving the model for technical inefficiency effects is applied separately to samples of semi-intensive/intensive and extensive carp producers interviewed during 1994-95. The results showed significant technical inefficiencies in carp production in India, especially among extensive farms. The mean technical efficiencies for semi-intensive/intensive and extensive sample farms were estimated to be 0.805 and 0.658 respectively. By operating at full technical efficiency levels, the semi-intensive/intensive farms could, on average, increase their production from about 3.4 Mt ha(-1) to 4.1 Mt ha(-1). Likewise, the extensive farms could increase their production from 1.3 Mt ha(-1) to 1.9 Mt ha(-1). Much of these efficiency gains would come from improvement in the adoption of recommended fish, water and feed management and monitoring practices. Besides expanding production area, the results indicated several other possibilities for increasing carp production in India by increasing yields per hectare, such as: (1) increased intensification of carp culture (i.e. moving from extensive to semi-intensive or intensive systems); (2) improvement in technical efficiency at the farm level; and (3) technological progress. However, the realization of these potentials will depend on continuous efforts by the government in ensuring an adequate supply of inputs, technology transfer and development and adequate provision of research, extension and credit services in aquaculture.},

abstract = {In this paper, a translog profit function was applied to estimate the economic values of the traits included in the breeding goal for Norwegian Red dairy cattle. The following 10 traits are included in the breeding goal: milk, meat, mastitis resistance, fertility, calving difficulties, stillbirths, other diseases, udder, temperament, and legs. An empirical implementation that locally approximates the unknown true profit function was suggested and estimated, taking farm heterogeneity into account. The model was applied to a panel data set of 3,259 Norwegian dairy farms over the period 1999 to 2003. Panel data, also called longitudinal or cross-sectional time-series data, are multiple cases (cows, farms, countries, etc.) observed over 2 or more time periods. The data set consisted of farm-level data, including production and economic data from the farm and the estimated breeding values for each cow's sire. The estimated economic values make it possible to test whether genetic selection has been profitable for the farmer, and the extent to which the currently used economic values were optimal during the period 1999 to 2003. Although the translog profit function is quite flexible, it is rather complex, and a simplified version of the model, a Cobb-Douglas profit function, was also estimated. However, the hypothesis that this simpler function adequately describes the data compared with the full translog model was rejected. Further, the hypothesis that the estimated breeding values are profit neutral was rejected (i.e., the hypothesis that there are no interactions between input and output prices on one hand and estimated breeding values on the other). These results indicated that selection not only leads to a parallel shift in profits, but also to changes in input use. Seven of the 10 traits had a significant effect on the farmers' profit. The 3 traits that were not significant were calving difficulty, stillbirth, and other diseases. The results showed that the breeding program for Norwegian Red cattle has been fairly successful in improving farmers' profits. However, a slight modification of the breeding goal, such as a reduction in the weights for stillbirths and other diseases and an increase in the weights for meat and temperament, would increase farm profits.},

abstract = {European fish stocks have been overfished for decades and fishing fleets remain too large for the marine resources available. Fish populations could increase and generate more economic value if fishing pressure were reduced for just a few years. Hake has historically been the most representative commercial species of the Spanish fishing sector in the 20th century, and is in high demand in the Spanish market. In this paper we calculate the direct economic value of the Southern stock of European hake (Merluccius merluccius) under “recent catches” and different “rebuilding” scenarios. Three different scenarios are analysed and compared: (i) the real stock situation between 1986 and 2005; (ii) biomass simulation of the stock if the European Union (EU) fishing fleet had followed the ICES scientific recommendations (SRs) for quota allocation from 1986 to 2005; and (iii) biomass simulation of the stock if the EU fishing fleet progressively reduces discards as proposed by the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) reform between 2012 and 2022. The results suggest that the fishing industry prefers short-term economic profits, because the value of the stock was {\$}415 million, which is higher than the {\$}245 million obtained if the proposed SRs had been respected. If the exploitation rate of the last 20 years continues under the new CFP, the economic value of the stock amounts to only U{\$}S258 million, which is well below the {\$}415 million obtained between 1986 and 2005. Even if the discard volume were progressively reduced by 10–20{\%}, the economic value of the stock would reach only {\$}300 million, which is well below the {\$}436 million estimated by our model if the SRs had been followed. The benefits of following SRs are not restricted to higher economic benefits, but; subsequent restrictive measures on fishing to ensure recovery of the stock might be lower, while consumers would have access to protein from the sea at more affordable prices.},

abstract = {'Risk' has appeared more frequently in the fisheries management literature in recent years. The reasons for this are partly internal (scientists seeking better ways to advise fishery managers) and partly external (e.g., adoption of the precautionary approach). Though terminology varies, there is consensus that there are two stages in dealing with risk. The first (here called risk assessment) is the formulation of advice for fisheries managers in a way that conveys the possible consequences of uncertainty. This advice is in the form of an evaluation of the expected effects of alternative management options, rather than recommendations. Risk assessment has been undertaken in many fisheries, and there is general agreement as to how it should be done (although technical details differ). The second stage (risk management) is the way fishery managers take uncertainty into account in making decisions. Much fisheries risk management is informal, i.e., nonquantitative, undocumented, and loosely linked (if at all) with a risk assessment. The major reason for this is that the objectives of fisheries management are often conflicting and are rarely stated in a way that provides explicit direction to managers or scientists.},

abstract = {ITQs offer environmental and economic benefits, including better conservation of a fish stock and greater profitability for fishers. With some limitations, they achieve fairly good alignment between the profit incentive and stewardship objectives. Nevertheless, critics have objected to ITQ schemes because of such factors as the "armchair fishing" phenomenon, unfairness to the public (the owner of the fish), economic and social damage to remote communities, and increased concentration within the fishery. Economists generally dismiss these as distributional issues rather than matters of efficiency or economics, but economic principles are clearly not the only factors that may require attention or action from a government or regulator. This paper proposes an intervention that addresses these concerns within the context of an ITQ scheme. The intervention does not reduce the permanence or values of ITQs, and therefore retains the benefits that ITQs are designed to deliver. Nevertheless, the intervention addresses the criticisms identified above. Modifications of the intervention may enable additional goals and benefits to be achieved as well. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Norwegian spring spawning herring has undergone great fluctuations in abundance and changes in migration. In the middle of this century the stock was in a productive phase, after which a serious depletion took place and the stock collapsed by the end of the 1960s. The primary factor for the collapse was high fishing pressure. A gradual, but small increase in the adult stock took place between 1974 and 1986. In this period the adult herring did not leave the coast after spawning to feed in the Norwegian Sea, as in previous years, but remained near shore to feed and later migrated into the fjords for wintering. The only numerous year class between 1970 and 1987 was that of 1983. When this year class became mature a significant increase in the spawning stock took place. At the same time a change in the migration pattern was recorded. From 1989 spawning extended southwards along the Norwegian coast, and during the 1990s the Norwegian Sea was increasingly reutilized for feeding. However, wintering still took place in the fjords. Two strong year classes, those of 1991 and 1992, started to recruit to the spawning stock in 1994 and 1995. The subsequent three year classes are weak and a decline in the spawning stock size is expected after 1997-98. Without agreement on total allowable catches (TACs), which limit fishing mortality to a low level, the spawning stock may again decrease below the minimum biological acceptable limit, and the potential largest fish resource in the North Atlantic may again be depleted.},

The procedure provides a visually clear representation of where in the density of wages these various factors exert the greatest impact. Using data from the Current Population Survey, we find, as in previous research, that de-unionization and supply and demand shocks were important factors in explaining the rise in wage inequality from 1979 to 1988. We find also compelling visual and quantitative evidence that the decline in the real value of the minimum wage explains a substantial proportion of this increase in wage inequality, particularly for women. We conclude that labor market institutions are as important as supply and demand considerations in explaining changes in the U.S. distribution of wages from 1979 to 1988.},

abstract = {This paper gives an account of the development of fishery regulation and management in Iceland, including the development of cod stocks, and the fishing fleet in Iceland since 1945. There was considerable experimentation with fishery management systems in Iceland beginning in 1975. Many economists and others predicted that the fishing fleet would be reduced as a result of the new regimes, but this has not happened to the extent anticipated. Local governments have traditionally had a stake in the Icelandic fisheries. The motives of local municipalities might conflict with the motives pursued by the fishery managers. A theoretical model is developed to understand the consequences of local politicians' involvement in the quota market. Furthermore, it is indicated that the degree of ease with which the less effective fishing firms find ways to circumvent the profitability consequences of the management regime depends on the initial allocation of fishing rights.},

abstract = {Most growth studies have considered the relationship between age and growth. Such relationships are essential to age-structured fishery stock assessments. In contrast, assessments based on stage-structured population dynamics models require information on the probability of animals moving from one stage to each of the other stages at each time-step. Size-structured population dynamics models are a special case of stage-structured population dynamics models in which each class represents a unique set of sizes. These models form the basis of assessments for many valuable, hard to age, marine species, including crabs, abalone, lobsters and prawns. Growth within these models is governed by a size-transition matrix. The values for the parameters of a size-transition matrix can either be estimated externally to the assessment, generally utilizing data from tag-recapture experiments, or the estimation of growth can be integrated within the assessment model. This paper reviews the approaches used to construct size-transition matrices, including the underlying structural formulation, statistical estimation framework, and the consequences of error when specifying these matrices on the ability to estimate population size and manage populations sustainably.},

abstract = {Excess capacity is a major concern for fisheries management worldwide. It is often argued that Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) systems will enhance efficiency and alleviate problems of excess capacity. While improvements in efficiency have been observed, most empirical studies have found only modest changes in excess capacity as a result of such systems. Using a database of compulsory log-book information for the Tasmanian Rock Lobster Fishery in Australia, from January 2000 to December 2013, this study presents the first analysis to investigate the dynamic behaviour of both excess capacity and efficiency (i.e. technical and scale efficiency) in an industrialised fleet after the introduction of quota management. The analysis revealed weak evidence for a prolonged adjustment in the fishery following the introduction of an ITQ system. In addition, no marked changes in excess capacity were observed over the study period; and furthermore, there was no evidence for an increase in excess capacity during a period of non-binding Total Allowable Catch (TAC) when race to fish behaviour increased in the fishery. The results suggest a limited ability of the ITQ system to alleviate levels of excess capacity in fisheries in the long-term.},

The concept has now been adopted by many international agreements and national governments and is in the process of being implemented. This paper seeks to review the literature and to analyze the understanding of the subject. The term is defined and its implementation in fisheries and for all marine uses is analyzed. It has been concluded that to understand marine ecosystem based management one must consider ecosystems as complex adaptive systems which can show changes at higher levels from actions and processes occurring at lower levels. Recognizing that humans are part of these complex adaptive systems is vital in that their actions along with other processes can lead to transformations in ecosystem functioning. This recognition is also important to show how society can sustainably exploit these resources and that the inclusion of all stakeholders in the management process is necessary to legitimize the process. The uses of the precautionary principle along with adaptive management are seen to be useful tools in implementing these insights into the management of natural resources. Finally, the need for reducing consumption of fish is considered.},

abstract = {A separable catch-age stock assessment model that accommodates predation mortality is applied to the Gulf of Alaska walleye pollock (Theragra chalcogramma) assessment. Three predators are incorporated in the model: Arrowtooth flounder (Atheresthes stomias), Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis), and Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus). The effect of these predators is examined by defining the predation mortality as a type of fishery. The model is used to quantify changes in the relative fit to the survey, fishery, and predator data when the assumption of constant natural mortality is relaxed. Specifically, we examine the effect of assumptions regarding the functional feeding response, residual naturaly mortality, and uncertainty in predator biomass on stock assessment. Total natural mortality rates (including predation) tended to be higher than estimated from life history characteristics of the stock. Models that did not account for uncertainty in natural mortality underestimated uncertainty in current stock biomass by as much as 20{\%}. Our results indicate that independent estimates of survey selectivity, additional food habits data, and estimates of the feeding responses of predators to different prey densities are all needed to improve our ability to develop stock assessment models that address ecosystem concerns.

The set of axioms corresponding to hierarchic structures are a special case of axioms for priority setting in systems with feedback which allow for a wide class of dependencies. The axioms highlight: (1) the reciprocal property that is basic in making paired comparisons; (2) homoge-neity that is characteristic of people's ability for making comparisons among things that are not too dissimilar with respect to a common property and, hence, the need for arranging them within an order preserving hierarchy; (3) dependence of a lower level on the adjacent higher level; (4) the idea that an outcome can only reflect expectations when the latter are well represented in the hierarchy. The AHP neither assumes transitivity (or the stronger condition of consistency) nor does it include strong assumptions of the usual notions of rationality. A number of facts are derived from these axioms providing an operational basis for the AHP.},

Second, while in theory there is a separation of biological and economic conceptions of sustainability in the QMS, these processes are, in fact, deeply intertwined.

The ecosystem approach is necessary, especially to account for fishery-ecosystem interactions, but by itself is not sufficient to address two important factors contributing to unsustainable fisheries: inappropriate incentives bearing on fishers and the ineffective governance that frequently exists in commercial, developed fisheries managed primarily by total-harvest limits and input controls. We contend that much greater emphasis must be placed on fisher motivation when managing fisheries. Using evidence from more than a dozen natural experiments in commercial fisheries, we argue that incentive-based approaches that better specify community and individual harvest or territorial rights and price ecosystem services and that are coupled with public research, monitoring, and effective oversight promote sustainable fisheries.},

abstract = {A model with nonlinear discarding costs is developed for a fishery with an individual transferable quota (ITQ) program. The model shows that limited hold capacity and ITQs provide incentives to discard fish. The model is applied to the Icelandic ITQ-regulated cod fishery to test for highgrading and to predict the discarded quantities of different grades of fish. The results indicate that vessels are involved in highgrading, but there is no evidence of quota price-induced highgrading. The predicted total discarded quantities are 4.7{\%} and 2.7{\%} of total landings for gillnet and longline vessels, respectively. These correspond well with official biometric estimates.

abstract = {Many modern spatially explicit ecosystem models use modelling subdomains of different shape and size ('polygons') to resolve space, and movement of biomass between them forms an important part of the modelling effort. In marine applications, a flow field grid describing the water movement usually forms the basis for movement of passive or nearly passive biomass. Grid-based advection algorithms are not designed to model movement on the larger scale of polygons, resulting in disproportionally large computational costs and difficult communication between model layers. In this paper, a simple and effective algorithm to model movement at the polygon level is proposed, preserving the general properties of biomass distribution in comparison to a grid-scale model. A nonparametric description of inter-polygon movement in the domain is generated which is used to approximately replicate the observed movement pattern. To estimate the movement description, the moves of passive numerical drifters between polygons are observed. The resulting algorithm outperforms the conventional polygon-based transport equation approach both in artificial and realistic scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The Namibian sardine stock has experienced intense exploitation since 1950, with catches peaking at 1.4 million tonnes in 1968, followed by a collapse in the 1970s and 1980s. Namibia therefore inherited a severely depleted stock at Independence in 1990. The paper describes data available since Independence, which includes research survey data, and length frequencies obtained from port sampling. It also presents age-structured stock assessment models, which consider some of the main sources of uncertainty relating to values for natural mortality, and assumptions about survey bias, density-dependent effects in survey bias and variance, and the form of the stock-recruit curve. These models could be used as "operating models" to underpin the future development of management procedures for Namibian sardine. Despite reasonable fits, 95{\%} confidence intervals for natural mortality are fairly wide and estimates of precision poor for most models considered. However, the model that assumes density-dependence in survey variance shows superior fits and improved estimates compared to the others, despite reservations about the existence of such effects. This indicates the need to explore the possibility of density-dependence in survey variance further if future management procedure performance is negatively affected by it.

The public accessibility of such networks with the ability to share opinions, thoughts, information, and experience offers great promise to enterprises and governments. In addition to individuals using such networks to connect to their friends and families, governments and enterprises have started exploiting these platforms for delivering their services to citizens and customers. However, the success of such attempts relies on the level of trust that members have with each other as well as with the service provider. Therefore, trust becomes an essential and important element of a successful social network. In this article, we present the first comprehensive review of social and computer science literature on trust in social networks. We first review the existing definitions of trust and define social trust in the context of social networks. We then discuss recent works addressing three aspects of social trust: trust information collection, trust evaluation, and trust dissemination. Finally, we compare and contrast the literature and identify areas for further research in social trust.},

abstract = {With fisheries resources being overexploited during the last decades, the matching of fleet capacity to resource conservation levels is urgently required. Data Envelopment Analysis was implemented to estimate and assess capacity utilization and efficiency for the first time in the eastern Mediterranean. The purse-seine fleet segments were found to operate below their capacity output level indicating the existence of overcapacity. The 24-40 m segment was evidenced to be more efficient than the 12-24 m fleet segment. Results suggested that purse-seiners could have increased their output by 89{\%} (12-24 m) and 48{\%} (24-40 m) providing current stock status and unrestricted access to resources. Fishing vessels may potentially improve their earnings by approximately 20{\%} by increasing variable inputs. In data poor environments, such as the Mediterranean Sea, the simple DEA models applied in this study provide a useful approach to capacity and efficiency assessment. The quantitative measures of excess and overcapacity obtained, may contribute valuable information in balancing the productive capacity of the stock with the harvesting capacity of the fleet. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We begin by documenting the extent of, theoretical rationale for, and measured performance of state-owned banks around the world, and then assess why many governments have chosen to privatize their often very large state-owned banking sectors. The empirical evidence clearly shows that state-owned banks are less efficient than privately owned banks, and that state domination of banking imposes increasingly severe penalties on those countries with the largest state banking sectors. On the other hand, there is little in the empirical record to suggest that privatization alone transforms the efficiency of divested banks, especially when these are only partially privatized. Privatization generally improves performance, but by far less than is typically observed in studies of non-financial industries. An increasingly common outcome of large-scale bank privatization programs is foreign ownership of many nations' banking sector, which evidence suggests is usually positive in an economic sense, but problematic politically. ?? 2005 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {We contrast two paradigms for fisheries management decision making: the ‘‘assessment'' paradigm, which is based around stock assessments, and the ‘‘procedural'' paradigm, which is based around management procedures. The assessment paradigm has difficulty in providing management for data-poor stocks, and we illustrate this in the New Zealand context. In contrast, the procedural paradigm has the potential to be useful for the data-poor stocks. However, to date, it has not served data-poor fisheries well because most of the development of management procedures has been for high-value, data-rich stocks. This may be because several aspects of the procedural paradigm are misunderstood or neglected. Giving appropriate attention to these aspects will improve the application of fisheries management procedures, particularly for data-poor stocks. For example, more attention needs to be given to the method for presenting evaluation results to decision makers in ways that more easily allow them to make trade-offs among multiple management objectives. We also argue that the design, evaluation, and selection of management procedures should be treated as an exercise in engineering, particularly by applying generic solutions to data-poor cases for which specific solutions are usually not readily developed.},

abstract = {Increasing levels of fisheries collapse are now widely believed to be the consequence of ineffective centralized management of the common pool. In theory, realigning incentives for ecologically sustainable and economically prosperous fisheries requires assigning property rights to the resource, which will then encourage owners to internalize the effects on sustainability of current resource management decisions. In fisheries, property rights can be assigned in a variety of ways, including rights to harvest a certain fraction of the allowable catch (individual transferable quotas, ITQs), rights to exclusive harvest within a given geographic region (territorial use rights fisheries, TURFs), and rights to manage a resource stock collaboratively through a group with well-defined membership (cooperatives). The relative performance of each of these approaches will, at least in principle, depend on the specifics of the fishery in question, suggesting that correctly designing property rights institutions to match the fishery context is crucial to success.},

It has been increasingly recognized, however, that modeling and measuring fisheries' production relationships is central to understanding and ultimately correcting the repercussions of externalities and poorly designed regulations. We use a transformation function production model to estimate productivity and its components for catcher–processors in the Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands pollock fishery, before and after the introduction of a cooperative system that grants exclusive harvesting privileges and allows quota exchange. We also recognize the roles of externalities from pollock harvesting by incorporating data on climate, bycatch, and fish biomass. We find that productivity has been increasing over time, that many productive contributions and interactions of climate, bycatch, and fishing strategies are statistically significant, and that regulatory changes have had both direct and indirect impacts on catch patterns and productivity.},

abstract = {Contaminated sediments and other sites present a difficult challenge for environmental decisionmakers. They are typically slow to recover or attenuate naturally, may involve multiple regulatory agencies and stakeholder groups, and engender multiple toxicological and ecotoxicological risks. While environmental decision-making strategies over the last several decades have evolved into increasingly more sophisticated, information-intensive, and complex approaches, there remains considerable dissatisfaction among business, industry, and the public with existing management strategies. Consequently, contaminated sediments and materials are the subject of intense technology development, such as beneficial reuse or in situ treatment. However, current decision analysis approaches, such as comparative risk assessment, benefit-cost analysis, and life cycle assessment, do not offer a comprehensive approach for incorporating the varied types of information and multiple stakeholder and public views that must typically be brought to bear when new technologies are under consideration. Alternatively, multicriteria decision analysis (MCDA) offers a scientifically sound decision framework for management of contaminated materials or sites where stakeholder participation is of crucial concern and criteria such as economics, environmental impacts, safety, and risk cannot be easily condensed into simple monetary expressions. This article brings together a multidisciplinary review of existing decision-making approaches at regulatory agencies in the United States and Europe and synthesizes state-of-the-art research in MCDA methods applicable to the assessment of contaminated sediment management technologies. Additionally, it tests an MCDA approach for coupling expert judgment and stakeholder values in a hypothetical contaminated sediments management case study wherein MCDA is used as a tool for testing stakeholder responses to and improving expert assessment of innovative contaminated sediments technologies.},

abstract = {While neoliberalism is often framed as a withdrawal of the state, many scholars have noted that what is
occurring is not so much a withdrawal, as a repositioning. Although many social services and regulatory functions once provided by government agencies have indeed been eroded, there has been a simultaneous
channeling of new resources into other arenas, in an effort to create conditions in which private corporations can operate more profitably. This, however, often places the state in a contradictory position, simultaneously
serving as regulator, investor, and development advocate for the private sector. This can become especially problematic in moments of ecological crisis when decisive and unbiased responses are needed. This paper explores these dynamics through an examination of the cycles of growth and crisis that have characterized the
aquaculture industry on the south coast of Newfoundland since the late 1970s as well as the ongoing attempts by aquaculture advocates to characterize industrial-scale fish farming as a sustainable industry, despite evidence
to the contrary.},

abstract = {Bayesian models require the specification of prior distributions for all unknown parameters, and this formal utilization of prior knowledge (if any) can be used to great advantage in some fisheries. However, regardless of whether prior knowledge about model parameters is available, specification of prior distributions is seldom unequivocal. This work addresses the problem of specifying default priors for several common fisheries models. To maintain consistency of terminology with the statistical literature, such priors are herein called reference priors to recognize that they can be interpreted as providing a sensible reference point against which the implications of alternative priors can be compared. Here, the Jeffreys' prior is demonstrated for the Ricker and Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curves, von Bertalanffy growth curve, Schaefer surplus production model, and sequential population analysis. The Jeffreys' priors for relevant derived parameters are demonstrated, including the steepness parameter of the Beverton-Holt stock-recruit curve. The sequential population analysis example is used to show that the Jeffreys' prior should not be automatically accepted as a reference prior in all models-this needs to be decided on a case-by-case basis.},

abstract = {Recent failures of important fish stocks give mathematical models a poor reputation as tools for fishery management. This paper examines the role of models in fish stock assessment and identifies reasons why they can fail. Starting with laws of arithmetic, models attempt to relate observed data to unknown quantities, such as the stock biomass and abundance. Typically, the number of unknowns greatly exceeds the number of observations, and models must impose hypothetical constraints to give useful estimates. We use the word "fishmetic" (rhymes with arithmetic) to represent uncertainty in the conversion of arithmetic to practical fishery models. Arbitrary assumptions cannot be avoided, even though different choices can greatly influence the outcome of the analysis. We compare the modeling process in fisheries with that in other sciences. World literature also offers useful analogies. Potential reasons for failure suggest possible improvements to the application of fishery models. We recommend that modelers remain skeptical, expand their knowledge base, apply common sense, and implement robust strategies for fishery management. Particularly creative thought must be applied to the problem of translating scientific knowledge into management practice. Comparisons between fish stocks and financial stocks illustrate some possibilities.},

Here, using a decade-long multinational 'catch reconstruction' project covering the Exclusive Economic Zones of the world's maritime countries and the High Seas from 1950 to 2010, and accounting for all fisheries, we identify catch trajectories differing considerably from the national data submitted to the FAO. We suggest that catch actually peaked at 130 million tonnes, and has been declining much more strongly since. This decline in reconstructed catches reflects declines in industrial catches and to a smaller extent declining discards, despite industrial fishing having expanded from industrialized countries to the waters of developing countries. The differing trajectories documented here suggest a need for improved monitoring of all fisheries, including often neglected small-scale fisheries, and illegal and other problematic fisheries, as well as discarded bycatch.},

Long-run curves of individual demand and cost are flatter than commonly represented, and the imperfections of competition corre-spondingly less. Industry subject to fluctuating demand requires prices in excess of short-run marginal cost. Favorable conditions appear to include a sloping individual demand curve, and some uncertainty whether a reduction of price will be promptly met. With standardized products, a chaotic market tends toward ruinous competition. Pure oligopoly is seldom found; the important case being that of openly-quoted prices with varying amounts of deviations on actual sales. Standard products with sloping individual demand curves are also possible. While extreme quality differentials approach monopoly, more moderate ones may be workably competitive, especially with further growth of closer substitutes and better knowledge of qualities on the part of buyers.},

@article{Arnason2009c,
abstract = {Fisheries are subject to a deep-rooted problem of economic inefficiency, often referred to as the fisheries problem. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones. Which institutions are most appropriate depends on the social objectives of the fisheries. There are strong economic arguments for the view that there should be only a single objective, namely to maximize the present value of the flow of benefits from the fisheries. In reality, different interest groups often push for several, often conflicting, objectives. In that case a multi-objective programming approach may be appropriate. A set of institutions to manage fisheries is referred to as the fisheries management regime. The fisheries management regime consists of a (i) fisheries management system, (ii) fisheries enforcement system and (iii) fisheries judicial system. Each one of these has to be appropriately designed and implemented. The efficacy of the overall fisheries management regime cannot be greater than that of its weakest link. At the same time it is of the greatest importance to keep an eye on the cost of fisheries management. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. The problem, thus, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and its cost of design, implementation and operation. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multidisciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with. ?? 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Simulations were performed with the Canadian mesoscale compressible community (MC2) model driven by control and high CO2 climate estimates from the Canadian Climate Centre model, the Second Generation Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM2). CGCM2 simulations have effective CO2 concentration forcing, following the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) IS92a scenario conditions, which define a near doubling of CO2 concentrations by 2050 compared to the 1980s. The control and high CO2 conditions were obtained from years 197594 and 204059 of CGCM2 simulations. For the northwest Atlantic, the CO2-induced warming for this period (204059) varies from 12C in the subtropics, near the main development region for Atlantic hurricanes, to 1C in the north. In simulations of northwest Atlantic storms, the net impact of this enhanced CO2 scenario is to cause storms to increase in radius, with marginal tendencies to become more severe and to propagate faster (although not statistically significant), and for the mean storm tracks to shift slightly poleward.},

abstract = {Low densities of harbour porpoises in winter (November–March) and high densities in summer (April– October) were found in the Sound, connecting the Baltic Sea and Kattegat. Due to their high energy requirements, it is hypothesized that the density of harbour porpoises is related to local prey abundance. This was tested by examin- ing the stomach content of 53 harbour porpoises collected between 1987 and 2010 in the Sound (high season, 34 por- poises; low season, 19 porpoises). A total of 1,442 individ- ual Wsh specimens from thirteen species were identiWed. Twelve of these were present in the high–porpoise density season and seven in the low-density season. The distribu- tion of occurrence and the distribution of number of Wsh species were diVerent between seasons, indicating a shift in prey intake between seasons. Furthermore, during the high- density season, the mean and total prey weight per stomach as well as the prey species diversity was higher. However, no diVerence was found in the number of prey species between the two seasons, indicating a higher quality of prey in the high-density season. Atlantic cod was found to be the main prey species in terms of weight in the high-density season while Atlantic herring and Atlantic cod were equally important during the low-density season. Prey availability and predictability are suggested as the main drivers for har- bour porpoise distribution, and this could be caused by the formation of frontal zones in spring in the northern part of the Sound, leading to prey concentrations in predictable areas.},

An alternative HCR, based on default limit and upper stock reference (USR) points at 0.4 BMSY and 0.8 BMSY, was recently developed under Canada's precautionary fisheries management policy. We simulated the Pacific herring fishery management system to examine whether (i) realized fishery performance over the past 10 years is an expected consequence of applying the existing herring HCR (with a single lower reference point) and (ii) performance could be improved by adopting the Department of Fisheries and Oceans new HCR with limit and USR points. Both HCRs successfully rebuilt stocks to sustainable levels under a high-productivity scenario, but performed poorly when stock productivity was low. The two HCRs were sensitive to stock productivity, because the effect of a target harvest rate (20{\%}) that is independent of productivity was much larger than the effects of biomass reference-point choices. We therefore recommend further research on estimating reference points and sustainable harvest rates for Pacific herring, so that HCRs may be made more responsive to changes in productivity.},

Inputs can be fixed (e.g. the vessel, gear, engine, onboard equipment, etc.) or variable (e.g. time spent fishing, size of crew). Fixed inputs may also be intangible, such as skipper skill and quality differences between technologies. TE scores can be calculated using the econometric stochastic production frontier (SPF) or the non-stochastic, linear-programming data envelopment analysis (DEA) methodologies. This paper compares the results of both techniques for segments of the English Channel fisheries. The influence of factors most affecting technical efficiency is analysed using an SPF inefficiency model and tobit regression of DEA-derived scores. Such factors include vessel and skipper characteristics. It is argued that DEA can be used as an alternative to SPF techniques when there is difficulty in specifying the correct SPF model. There is general consistency between SPF and DEA analyses in regard to the factors affecting TE.},

Provided that these tasks are imperfect substitutes, our model implies measurable changes in the composition of job tasks, which we explore using representative data on task input for 1960 to 1998. We ?nd that within industries, occupations, and education groups, computerization is asso- ciated with reduced labor input of routine manual and routine cognitive tasks and increased labor input of nonroutine cognitive tasks. Translating task shifts into education demand, the model can explain 60 percent of the estimated relative de- mand shift favoring college labor during 1970 to 1998. Task changes within nomi- nally identical occupations account for almost half of this impact. INTRODUCTION},

A growing body of empirical literature measures the efficiency gains from mergers and acquisitions; however there is little sense of how the results might depend on the country, industry and time period analyzed. In this paper we review critically works that cover the main sectors of the financial industry (commercial and investment banks, insurance and asset management companies) in the major industrialized countries over the last 20 years, searching for common patterns that transcend national and sectoral peculiarities. We find that consolidation in the financial sector is beneficial up to a relatively small size, but there is little evidence that mergers yield economies of scope or gains in managerial efficiency.},

Catchability is modeled using both continuous and categorical explanatory variables.

The method is applied to a New Zealand rock lobster ({\textless}I{\textgreater}Jasus edwardsii{\textless}/I{\textgreater}) stock, and the results are compared with those obtained using a generalized linear model.

An important example is the implementation of rights based management in fisheries, which has seen considerable political opposition despite its well­documented benefits of increased harvesting efficiency and fishery health. ​ This paper explores the role of harvester location and landings history in determining this opposition. ​ Using a novel data set of written and oral public comments from the Alaskan Halibut and Sablefish fisheries, harvester position is observed. Commenter information, such as name, address, and/or vessel name, is then linked to vessel ownership data and harvester performance. ​ The initial allocation of quota, which is primarily done through grandfathering, and harvester location are predicted to be important determinants of opposition. ​ Remote communities may see reduced landings while individuals with inconsistent participation history in the fisheries receive a relatively lower share of the initial allocation. ​ Results show a harvester who misses a single year during the grandfathering period is 18­26{\%} more likely to oppose rationalization. Harvesters located in remote communities are 30{\%} more likely to oppose rationalization. Understanding the distributional issues that determine opposition may allow policymakers to better design politically feasible property­rights based resource management programs.},

The review is linked to North Sea demersal stocks. First, weaknesses in the various types of data used in North Sea assessments are summarized, i.e. total landings, discards, commercial and research vessel abundance indices, age-length keys and natural mortality (M). A list of features that an ideal assessment should have is put forward as a basis for comparing different methods. The importance of independence and weighting when combining different types of data in an assessment is stressed. Assessment methods considered are Virtual Population Analysis, ad hoc tuning, extended survivors analysis (XSA), year-class curves, catch-at-age modelling, and state-space models fitted by Kalman filter or Bayesian methods. Year-class curves (not to be confused with ‘catch-curves') are the favoured method because of their applicability to data sets separately, their visual appeal, simple statistical basis, minimal assumptions, the availability of confidence limits, and the ease with which estimates can be combined from different data sets after separate analyses. They do not estimate absolute stock numbers or F but neither do other methods unless M is accurately known, as is seldom true.},

Icelandic landings data for 14 demersal fish species during 2001–2013 are compared to implemented total allowable catches as well as catch limits recommended by the Marine Research Institute (MRI) and a proxy for annual market values. Landings surpassed legal limits of total allowable catch in 27{\%} of the cases (landings by species by fishing year), mostly due to species transformations, but TAC overages were not consistent for any species. Instead, catches of some species were consistently less than legal limits, with some indications that landings were related to profitability (i.e. landings were correlated with market value). However, landings surpassed MRI recommendations in 67{\%} of the cases, and landings of four species (Atlantic wolffish, haddock, monkfish and redfish) consistently exceeded MRI recommendations. Therefore, discrepancies between scientific recommendations for catch limits and quotas selected through the political process may represent a higher risk to long-term sustainability than catch-quota balancing mechanisms.},

abstract = {The results of fishery stock assessments based on the integrated analysis paradigm can be sensitive to the values for the factors used to weight each of the data types included in the objective function minimized to obtain the estimates of the parameters of the model. These assessments generally include relative abundance index data, length-composition information and conditional age-at-length data, and algorithms have been developed to select weighting factors for each of these data types. This paper introduces methods for weighting conditional age-at-length data that extend an approach developed by Francis (2011) to weight age- and length-composition data. Simulation based on single-zone and two-zone operating models are used to compare five tuning methods that are constructed as combinations of methods to weight each data type. The single-zone operating models allow evaluation of the tuning methods in terms of their ability to provide unbiased estimates of management-related quantities and the correct data weights in the absence of model mis-specification, while the two-zone operating models allow the impacts of model mis-specification on the performance of tuning methods to be explored. The results of assessments are sensitive to data weighting, but the choice of method for data weighting is most consequential when there is model mis-specification. Overall, the results indicate that arithmetic averaging of effective sampling sample sizes from the McAllister and Ianelli (1997) approach is inferior to other methods, and the new method for computing effective sample sizes for conditional age-at-length data seems most appropriate.},

@article{Plosser1989,
abstract = {he 1 960s were a time of great optimism for macroeconomists. Many economists viewed the business cycle as dead. The Keynesian model was the reigning paradigm and it provided all the necessary instructions for manipulating the levers of monetary and fiscal policy to control aggregate demand. Inflation occurred if aggregate demand was stimulated "excessively" and unemployment arose if demand was "insufficient." The only dilemma faced by policymakers was determining the most desirable location along this inflation-unemployment tradeoff or Phillips curve. The remaining intellectual challenge was to establish coherent microeconomic founda-tions for the aggregate behavioral relations posited by the Keynesian framework, but this was broadly regarded as a detail that should not deter policymakers in their efforts to "stabilize" the economy. The return of the business cycle in the 1970s after almost a decade of economic expansion, and the accompanying high rates of inflation, came as a rude awakening for many economists. It became increasingly apparent that the basic Keynesian framework was not the appropriate vehicle for understanding what happens during a business cycle nor did it seem capable of providing the empirically correct answers to questions involving changes in the economic environment or changes in monetary or fiscal policy. The view that Keynesian economics was an empirical success even if it lacked sound theoretical foundations could no longer be taken seriously. The essential flaw in the Keynesian interpretation of macroeconomic phe-nomenon was the absence of a consistent foundation based on the choice theoretic framework of microeconomics. Two important papers, one by Milton Friedman (1968) and the other by Robert Lucas (1976), forcefully demonstrated examples of This content downloaded from 129.12.11.80 on Fri, 23 Oct 2015 07:48:15 UTC All use subject to JSTOR Terms and Conditions 52 Journal of Economic Perspectives this flaw in critical aspects of the Keynesian reasoning and set the stage for modern macroeconomics. A central feature of the Keynesian system of the 1960s was the tradeoff between inflation and some measure of real output or unemployment. Friedman argued that basic microeconomic principles demanded that this long run Phillips curve must be vertical. That is, general microeconomic principles implied that individuals (firms) maximizing their utility (profit) resulted in real demand (and supply) curves that are homogeneous of degree zero in nominal prices and money income. Thus sustained inflation was compatible with any level of real demand (or supply) of goods. A central Keynesian tenet was therefore in stark conflict with microeconomic principles.' Lucas reinforced this point by arguing that microeconomic foundations fre-quently implied that the sorts of behavioral relations exploited by the Keynesian model builders were incapable of correctly evaluating changes in economic policy. Lucas's specific examples stressed that expectations about future policy will systemati-cally influence current decisions and thus alter the behavioral relations exploited by empirical implementations of the Keynesian analysis. Moreover, Lucas argued, expec-tations could not be formulated or specified in an arbitrary manner and be consistent with individual maximization, but should be viewed as rational in the sense of Muth (1961). The absence of an underlying choice theoretic framework also plagued the dynamic elements of Keynesian models. Business cycles have long been characterized in terms of how they evolve over time. In particular, discussions regarding how shocks to the economic system were propagated across time and across sectors in the economy were a central theme of Mitchell (1927) and other early students of the business cycle such as von Hayek (1932). The foundations of the Keynesian model, however, were static and focused on determining output at a point in time, while treating the capital stock as given. Dynamic elements were introduced through accelerator mechanisms (investment and inventories) and later in the form of price or wage adjustment equations and partial adjustment models of one form or another. These dynamic specifications, however, did not arise from any choice theoretic framework of maxi-mization, but were simply behavioral rules that characterized either agents or, more frequently, markets in general. One economist's behavioral formulation for dynamic adjustment was as good as any other, and it was simply an empirical question which one seemed to fit the data best. These problems are fundamental. They suggest that the underpinnings of our understanding of economic fluctuations are likely to be found somewhere other than a suitably modified version of the Keynesian model. Indeed, there is a growing body of research in macroeconomics that begins with the idea that in order to understand business cycles, it is important and necessary to understand the characteristics of a perfectly working dynamic economic system.2 Hicks (1933, p. 32) makes this point quite clearly, arguing that the "idealized state of dynamic equilibrium... give(s) us a IThis interpretation of Friedman's discussion follows Lucas (1977). 2This view is explicit in the research program initiated by Long and Plosser (1983, p. 68).},

The model proved superior to an alternative model in its ability to estimate parameters central to the assessment; the alternative model subsumed cod predation as part of an overall population growth effect without a time trend. Two series of shrimp biomass indices, catch, cod biomass estimates, cod consumption estimates, and prior distributions of model parameters provided information to the models.

Not uncommon are changes as large as 10 percent within only a couple of years. These observations are con-sidered puzzling because the associated movements in labor's marginal product are small. These observations should not be puzzling, for they are what standard economic theory predicts. For the United States, in fact, given people's ability and willing-ness to intertemporally and intratemporally substitute consumption and leisure and given the nature of the changing production possibility set, it would be puz-zling if the economy did not display these large fluctua-tions in output and employment with little associated fluctuations in the marginal product of labor. Moreover, standard theory also correctly predicts the amplitude of these fluctuations, their serial correlation proper-ties, and the fact that the investment component of out-put is about six times as volatile as the consumption component. This perhaps surprising conclusion is the principal finding of a research program initiated by Kydland and me (1982) and extended by Kydland and me (1984), Hansen (1985a), and Bain (1985). We have computed the competitive equilibrium stochastic process for variants of the constant elasticity, stochastic growth model. The elasticities of substitution and the share parameters of the production and utility functions are restricted to those that generate the growth observa-tions. The process governing the technology parameter is selected to be consistent with the measured tech-nology changes for the American economy since the Korean War. We ask whether these artificial econo-mies display fluctuations with statistical properties similar to those which the American economy has dis-played in that period. They do.},

For a panel of Norwegian salmon farms fish feed and fish input are found to increase output risk, while labor has a risk-decreasing effect on output. In the analysis of technical change by the first order stochastic dominance criterion the increase in mean output dominates the increase in output risk.},

The author refers to Robert Malthus' famous book 'An Essay on the Principle of Population' (1798), which is most often credited with the pessimistic view that population growth carries with it the seeds of disaster for humanity and that population growth would inevitably press against the food supply. The author then looks at the question, what made it possible for the developed world to escape from what could be called the Malthusian trap during the nineteenth century? According to the author, the answer is the creation of knowledge. The author explains that there was an explosion of knowledge over the past two centuries that made possible an unparalleled increase in per capita well-being. New technologies have been developed at a rate unparalleled by historical standards. Three major factors are emphasized in the paper: the significant advances in agricultural productivity in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries; the enormous increase in knowledge over the past two centuries; and the response of families to the removal of restraints on their well-being imposed by limited food supplies.},

We exploit a Swedish reform which reduced UI duration from 90 to 60. weeks for a group of older unemployed workers in a setting where workers who exhausted their benefits received unchanged transfers if they agreed to participate in a work practice program. Our results show that job finding increased as a result of the shorter duration of passive benefits. The time profile of the job-finding effects suggests that the results are due to deterrence during the program-entry phase. We find no impact on ensuing job durations or wages, suggesting that the increased job-finding rate was driven by increased search intensity rather than lower reservation wages. A crude cost-benefit analysis suggests that the reform reduced the combined cost of programs and transfers. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

These methods are based on fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data for several regions in this fishery. This is to take account of the multi-gear nature of the fishery and the spatial structure of the trends in catch rate. The data on whether or not the catch rate is zero and the catch rate given that it is non-zero are analysed separately and then combined to provide indices of abundance. The former analysis is based on assuming the data are Bernoulli random variables. Given the uncertainty about the appropriate error-model to assume when fitting generalized linear models to catch and effort data, four alternative error-models - log-normal, log-gamma, Poisson, and negative binomial were explored when modelling the non-zero catch rates.

Interestingly, this result is robust to the various considered approaches. Moreover, it seems that the housing sector long-term trend possesses its own dynamics, quite different from the global French economic activity. Thus, in a second part, we review various structural factors that could drive housing market developments in France in the future.},

The empirical results of the meta-analysis are surprisingly clear-cut: Rather than contextual factors such as labor market institutions or the business cycle, it is almost exclusively the program type that seems to matter for program effectiveness. While direct employment programs in the public sector frequently appear detrimental, wage subsidies and "Services and Sanctions" can be effective in increasing participants' employment probability. Training programs - the most commonly used type of active policy - show modestly positive effects. ?? 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Catches and prices from many fisheries exhibit high interannual variability, leading to variability in the income derived by fishery participants. The economic risk posed by this may be mitigated in some cases if individuals participate in several different fisheries, particularly if revenues from those fisheries are uncorrelated or vary asynchronously. We construct indices of gross income diversification from fisheries at the level of individual vessels and find that the income of the current fleet of vessels on the US West Coast and in Alaska is less diverse than at any point in the past 30 y. We also find a dome-shaped relationship between the variability of individuals' income and income diversification, which implies that a small amount of diversification does not reduce income risk but that higher levels of diversification can substantially reduce the variability of income from fishing. Moving from a single fishery strategy to a 50-25-25 split in revenues reduces the expected coefficient of variation of gross revenues between 24{\%} and 65{\%} for the vessels included in this study. The increasing access restrictions in many marine fisheries through license reductions and moratoriums have the potential to limit fishermen's ability to diversify their income risk across multiple fisheries. Catch share programs often result in consolidation initially and may reduce diversification. However, catch share programs also make it feasible for fishermen to build a portfolio of harvest privileges and potentially reduce their income risk. Therefore, catch share programs create both threats and opportunities for fishermen wishing to maintain diversified fishing strategies.},

abstract = {Research by J.D. Sachs and A.M. Warner, indicates that resource-rich countries are less successful in terms of economic growth than are resource-poor countries. The question of what measures Icelanders need to take to prevent their fishery wealth from limiting economic growth is posed. The main body of the essay discusses arguments for a fishing fee. The principal arguments for a fishing fee are listed. One type of argument concerns flexibility, with a view to possibly introducing other forms of management or altering the distribution of profit in the future. Another type of argument concerns equity and fairness, contending that having a fishing fee makes it easier to ensure that the entire nation enjoys the benefit of the resource. A third type of argument is connected to risk-management, maintaining that, if properly arranged, a fishing fee would make it possible to offer vessel operators an indirect insurance policy which otherwise would not be available to them. The fourth type of argument concerns counter-cyclical policy and the problem of co-habitation of the fishery industry and other export industries and refers to the possibility of wage earners and/or taxpayers being forced (or tempted) to apply general policy instruments to secure a portion of the fishery rent. The general measures available to obtain a piece of the fishery rent share a common failing: their use unavoidably increases costs for other sectors of industry and thus limits possibilities for growth in those sectors and links their performance to fisheries performance. Then there are arguments for neutrality, based on the idea that the so-called resource rent taxes should not affect the use of the factors of production. Finally, there are economic growth arguments, which can be linked to theories of rent-seeking and Dutch disease.},

abstract = {A comprehensive list of planning criteria for optimizing compliance in Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) was compiled and used to compare the views of recreational fishers and compliance officers for facilitating voluntary compliance in the Port Stephens - Great Lakes Marine Park (PSGLMP). Expert working groups were tasked separately with: 1) criteria identification and weighting; 2) scoring of no-take zones; 3) prioritizing and determining uncertainty; and 4) analysis of results and sensitivity testing. Multi-Criteria Analysis (MCA) revealed that both groups had similar perspectives and recommendations, despite weighting the individual planning criteria differently. Significantly, "manageability" scores for no-take zones from MCA appeared to correlate well with past numbers of enforcement actions recorded for each zone. This provides empirical evidence that adopting manageability criteria during the planning of MPAs could lead to a marked increase in voluntary compliance. As a result, greater consideration to compliance planning during MPA design and zoning is recommended in order to optimize voluntary compliance. Whilst the majority of no-take zones in the PSGLMP case study were evaluated as being relatively effective in terms of optimizing voluntary compliance, there remains considerable potential to improve design, management and use of the poorer performing zones. Finally, the study highlighted the value of recreational fisher engagement in MPA planning processes to maximize voluntary compliance and manageability.},

The meeting and the BH concept as consolidated there highlighted some of the collateral ecological effects of current fishing patterns and unbalanced removals of particular components of the food web, stimulating a critical rethinking of current approaches to fisheries management. The meeting on “Balanced Harvest in the real world - Scientific, policy and operational issues in an ecosystem approach to fisheries” (Rome, September 29-October 2, 2014) examined the progress made since 2010 on a number of fronts. It considered questions related to the scientific underpinning of the BH concept, including theory, modelling, and empirical observations. It began to explore the economic, policy and management implications of harvesting in a more balanced way.},

This article explores how the EA is introduced into the EU Fisheries, with a focus on current interfaces and collaborative dynamics between science, policy and society in the context of implementing an Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management (EAFM). The scope of this work considers two EU policies that are of particular importance to frame the EAFM, namely the Common Fisheries Policy and the Marine Strategy Framework Directive. A short account of barriers that hinder the implementation of these two pieces of legislation is given. Further, society is considered through the Advisory Councils (AC) as a forum for articulating and representing a variety of civil society interests. The practical experiences of the science, policy, stakeholder (AC) interface in relation to EAFM are described. The article concludes with some of the perspectives and challenges ahead for EAFM in relation to the establishment of a co-creation process as a means to integrate and utilise multiple sources of knowledge (policy makers, scientists and stakeholders) achieving extended outcomes moving towards an EAFM. There is a long pathway to secure adequate science, policy, stakeholder interactions in support of EAFM. This must be supported through institutional structures and through improved coordination across a presently fragmented policy landscape.},

Generally understood as the direct marketing of seafood through pre-arranged deliveries, CSFs have increased in number and geographic distribution since their origin in 2007. Despite, or because of, this rapid growth, fundamental questions remain unanswered about what organizational structures and business practices currently constitute the term 'CSF'. This research draws on interview data from 22 CSFs to highlight the diversity within the CSF movement and inform ongoing debates about appropriate paths for their continued growth. Interview data is used to describe key areas of convergence and di-vergence among the goals, business practices, and structures of CSFs. Three general types of CSF are identified based on this analysis: harvester focused, consumer focused and species focused. Each type is described through a short illustrative case study. Overall results indicate that the term 'CSF' does not currently refer to a specific structure or type of organization, but rather an approach to seafood mar-keting used by a variety of organizations with broadly similar production philosophies centered on engaging and informing consumers around traceable, domestically sourced seafood. Acknowledgment of CSFs as diverse and socially embedded organizations is necessary to understanding their potential benefits.},

These two fishing methods are fundamentally different and have different economic, environmental, and even social effects. In this paper we present a hybrid-simulation framework to assess the impact of changing the ratio between cod quota allocated to vessels with longlines and vessels with bottom trawls. It makes use of conventional bioeconomic models and discrete event modelling and provides a framework for simulating life cycle assessment (LCA) for a cod fishery. The model consists of two submodels, a system dynamics model describing the biological aspect of the fishery and a discrete event model for fishing activities. The model was run multiple times for different quota allocation scenarios and results are presented where different scenarios are presented in the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. The optimal allocation strategy depends on weighing the three different factors. The results were encouraging first-steps towards a useful modelling method but the study would benefit greatly from better data on fishing activities.},

abstract = {Several empirical regularities motivate most theories of the distribution of labor earnings. Earnings distributions tend to be skewed to the right and display long right tails. Mean earnings always exceed median earnings and the top percentiles of earners account for quite a disproportionate share of total earnings. Mean earnings also differ greatly across groups defined by occupation, education, experience, and other observed traits. With respect to the evolution of the distribution of earnings for a given cohort, initial earnings dispersion is smaller than the dispersion observed in prime working years. We explore several models that address these stylized facts. Stochastic theories examine links between assumptions about the distribution of endowments and implied features of earnings distributions given assumptions about the processes that translate endowments into earnings. Selection models describe how workers choose a career. Because workers select their best option from a menu of possible careers, their allocation decisions tend to generate skewed earnings distributions. Sorting models illustrate this process in an environment where workers learn about their endowments and therefore adjust their allocation decisions over time. Human capital theory demonstrates that earnings dispersion is a prerequisite for significant skill investments. Without earnings dispersion, workers would not willingly make the investments necessary for high-skill jobs. Human capital models illustrate how endowments of wealth and talent influence the investment decisions that generate observed distributions of earnings. Agency models illustrate how wage structures may determine rather than reflect the worker productivity. Tournament theory addresses the long right tails of wage distributions within firms. Efficiency wage models address differences in wages across employments that involve different monitoring technologies.},

abstract = {Fisheries worldwide are subject to economic mismanagement of major proportions. Although most commercial fish stocks are capable of yielding high net profits (rents), only a relatively few fisheries are actually profitable. Rough estimates suggest that on a global scale, the loss of net economic benefits due to mismanagement of fisheries may easily amount to 50{\%} or more of the global landed value of some 100 billion US{\$} annually. The fisheries problem derives fundamentally from inappropriate social institutions controlling the fishing activity, the foremost of which is the common property arrangement. Fisheries management consists of replacing these institutions with more appropriate ones and, within that framework, setting the correct parameters over time. Global evidence suggests that the cost of fisheries management often constitutes a substantial fraction of the value of the harvest. A part of the fisheries management problem, therefore, is to strike the right balance between the efficacy of the fisheries management regime and the cost of operating it. The problem of fisheries management is by its nature multi-disciplinary. It involves marine ecology and biology, mathematics, economics, game theory, political science and anthropology to name a few. The problem is, moreover, typically quite complex, requiring powerful modelling and calculation techniques. In many respects, this is the kind of problem operations research techniques are designed to deal with.},

Much of this is due to the explicit recognition of the role of incentives in the management of fisheries, and the benefits that can be achieved through the maximisation of economic returns as a key management objective. However, while management of fisheries in Australia is supported through the application of bioeconomic models, these play virtually no role in fisheries management in New Zealand. This discrepancy is a direct result of the differing emphasis on how economic objectives are achieved, with Australia targeting maximum economic yield (MEY) while New Zealand targets maximum sustainable yield. We present case studies from Australia illustrating how bioeconomic models have been developed to support fisheries management and briefly discuss the situation in New Zealand. While economic considerations are important in both countries, we find that the explicit MEY target in Australian Commonwealth managed fisheries has been a key driver for the development and use of bioeconomic models in fisheries management.},

The objective of this research is to propose and test a model that illustrates the role of motivation to self-present to and learn from the community regarding consumers' willingness to interact in virtual food communities. The study investigates 1) the associations between the pre-existing consumer interests in food and general online interaction, and consumers' willingness to interact in virtual food communities, and 2) the mediating role of consumers' motivation to self-present to and learn from the community in explaining these associations. An online questionnaire (n = 980) was conducted among Danish consumers. Results showed that motivation to learn and motivation to self-present are strong mediators of the relationships especially between food involvement and behavioural interaction intention. The chance to learn from and present oneself to the community are reasons why consumers engage in interaction in virtual food communities, given their pre-existing interest in food and, to some extent, their general online interaction propensity. Virtual food communities should therefore provide consumers with the opportunity to present themselves as skilled individuals to the community and the opportunity to learn from the information available from that community. Still, community managers must keep in mind that these opportunities will only appeal to food involved consumers with a certain online interaction propensity.},

abstract = {A basic premise in the development of yield management has been that the differentiated fare products offered by airlines are targeted to distinct segments of the total demand for air travel in a market, each of which compete for space on a fixed capacity aircraft. Such representations of differential pricing assume that the airline can segment its demand perfectly and without cost to consumers, and further, ignore the dependence of the demand for a given fare product on the price levels and characteristics of the other available fare products. In this paper, we introduce a new 'generalised cost' model of fare product differentiation that incorporates the relationships between available airline fare products as well as the cost incurred by consumers of accepting more restrictions. We extend the model to incorporate the diversion of passengers to lower-priced fare products as a result of their ability to meet the additional restrictions imposed by airlines, and then demonstrate how seat inventory control can be used to induce diverting passengers to 'sell up' to higher-priced fare products by applying booking limits. An example of how the model can be used for joint fare product price level optimisation is presented, along with a numerical example that illustrates the extent to which the conventional model of price discrimination over-estimates passenger demand and, in turn, total airline revenues.},

In the lobster fishery, the right to fish has been concentrated since limited-entry licensing policy was introduced in the 1980s. This paper examines actors and events at two scales, including Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34 Advisory Committee meetings involving fishermen, re-presentatives of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and other stakeholders, and broader scale strategies of the Canadian Independent Fish Harvesters Federation (CIFHF). A Foucauldian perspective aids in un-derstanding how fisheries governance is the product of struggles between the power and agency of individual fishermen, fishing organizations, processing companies, the DFO, the Minister of Fisheries and the courts. While many theorists view fisheries through the lens of the " tragedy of the commons " , al-ternative tragedies are developing in Atlantic Canadian fisheries. These include rising levels of debt, reduced earnings, vulnerability to financial volatility, loss of fishing rights within communities, and too much processor control.},

abstract = {Management strategy evaluation (MSE) is often used in fisheries science to evaluate the effects of different management options. MSE models typically include a stock assessment component to estimate population size and management reference points based on data generated using the model, but including a full assessment within an MSE can be computationally intensive. A commonly used alternative to the full assessment approach is to simulate the error about the stock assessment outcomes as a stochastic process with an assumed level of autocorrelated estimation error. There is little guidance on what might be a reasonable assumed amount of autocorrelation, and what factors might influence this amount. We estimate the amount of temporal autocorrelation in errors of estimated biomass and recruitment from statistical catch at age stock assessment models over a series of scenarios spanning life histories, exploitation levels, recruitment variability, and data quality. Autocorrelation in the error in biomass estimates (. ϕ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}S{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) was positive and relatively high, with median estimates ranging between 0.7 and 0.9. Estimates were highest for the long-lived life history and lowest for the short-lived life history. Exploitation level also affected the amount of autocorrelation, with higher values for lightly exploited populations. On average, however, estimates of ϕ{\textless}inf{\textgreater}S{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} did not change over time as more data were included in the assessment, and were independent of whether or not a harvest policy was applied. Recruitment variability and data quality had relatively minor effects on autocorrelation of errors.},

abstract = {Environmental decision making typically concerns several stakeholders with conflicting views. Multicriteria decision analysis provides transparent ways to elicit and communicate individual preferences. When the stakeholders clearly understand each other's views, a consensus can be reached more easily. Computer software provides a substantial enhancement to support participatory decision making processes, for example, in the preference elicitation and in the analysis of the results. In this paper, we describe the first web-based multicriteria decision support software called Web-HIPRE, and the use of it in participatory environmental modelling. The world wide web provides new possibilities to support the process, for example, by allowing distributed decision support. The stakeholders can be located in different geographical areas, especially in environmental problems. We illustrate the use of Web-HIPRE in a case dealing with the evaluation of regulation policies for the Lake P{\"{a}}ij{\"{a}}nne in Finland. Decision analysis interviews were carried out and preference models of some typical stakeholders were collaboratively analyzed in order to increase the understanding of other stakeholders' views. This proved to be an applicable approach in trying to reach consensus between the stakeholders. Web-HIPRE also provided a flexible way to allow complementary support via the web. {\textcopyright}2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

In coastal areas, fishery cooperative associations have traditionally played an important role in managing fisheries through self-imposed rules and peer-monitoring systems. Recently, however, the economic competitiveness of Japanese fisheries in the international market is being questioned. In this paper, a detailed examination of the pros and cons of the current system in Japan is compared to the current fishery management measures of Iceland and the United States, where attaining economically or biologically efficient outcomes may be prioritized in making fisheries management decisions. For many coastal fisheries in Japan, maintaining a management scheme in which stakeholders play an active role in determining fisheries measures seems more relevant if their priority is to maintain the stability of coastal communities and equity of stakeholders. Intensive dialog among stakeholders would be necessary to identify shared objectives of their fishery operations and to make decisions to establish specific steps toward the goal of increasing economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, or stability of communities and equity of stakeholders. {\textcopyright}2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Social sustainability assessment of capture fisheries is, both in terms of method development and measurement, not well developed. The objective of this study, therefore, was to develop a method consisting of indicators and rubrics (i.e. categories that articulate levels of performance) to assess social sustainability of capture fisheries. This method was applied to a Norwegian trawler that targets cod and haddock in the northeast Atlantic. Based on previous research, 13 social sustainability issues were selected. To measure the state of these issues, 17 process and outcome indicators were determined. To interpret indicator values, rubrics were developed for each indicator, using standards set by international conventions or data retrieved from national statistics, industry agreements or scientific publications that explore rubric scales. The indicators and rubrics were subsequently used in a social sustainability assessment of a Norwegian trawler. This assessment indicated that overall, social sustainability of this trawler is relatively high, with high rubric scores, for example, for worker safety, provisions aboard for the crew and companies' salary levels. The assessment also indicated that the trawler could improve on healthy working environment, product freshness and fish welfare during capture. This application demonstrated that our method provides insight into social sustainability at the level of the vessel and can be used to identify potential room for improvement. This method is also promising for social sustainability assessment of other capture fisheries.},

As with fisheries management in most countries, multiple management objectives were implicit in policy statements, but were poorly specified in some areas (particularly social objectives) and strongly identified in others (e.g., an objective of sustainability). As a start to the management review process, an analysis of what objectives the management system should aim to achieve was undertaken. A review of natural resource management objectives employed internationally was used to develop a candidate list, and the objectives most relevant to the fishery were short-listed by a scientific advisory group. Additional objectives specific to Queensland fisheries management, but not identified in the international review, were also identified and incorporated into the objective set. The relative importance of the different objectives to different stakeholder groups was assessed using the Analytic Hierarchy Process. As with other studies, the relative importance of the different objectives varied both within and between the different stakeholder groups, although general trends in preferences were observed.},

abstract = {Statistical modeling involves building sufficiently complex models to represent the system being investigated. Overly complex models lead to imprecise parameter estimates, increase the subjective role of the modeler, and can distort the perceived characteristics of the system under investigation. One approach for controlling the tendency to increased complexity and subjectivity is to use model selection criteria that account for these factors. The effectiveness of two selection criteria was tested in an application with the stock assessment program known as Stock Synthesis. This program, which is often used on the U.S. west coast to assess the status of exploited marine fish stocks, can handle multiple data sets and mimic highly complex population dynamics. The Akaike information criterion and Schwarz's Bayesian information criterion are criteria that satisfy the fundamental principles of model selection: goodness-of-fit, parsimony, and objectivity. Their ability to select the correct model form and produce accurate estimates was evaluated in Monte Carlo experiments with the Stock Synthesis program. In general, the Akaike information criterion and the Bayesian information criterion had similar performance in selecting the correct model, and they produced comparable levels of accuracy in their estimates of ending stock biomass.},

abstract = {After the Second World War the Norwegian government planned a large scale modernization of the entire fishing industry in northern Norway. The industrialization of the land-based processing industry and the construction of a totally new trawler fleet gained massive public financial support. The new technological adaptations were built around a vertically integrated corporate model. As a reference to the modernization concept, the seasonal coastal fisheries were defined as outdated and not able to meet the modern expectations of full-time employment and improved salaries. In this context, the trawler fleet was supposed to feed the processing industry with stable supplies of fresh fish and thus secure a fully vertically integrated production model. However, almost from the start, the model never functioned according to the political goals, i.e. an economically viable sector with secure and stable employment. Instead, the project was characterized by efficiency problems, internal disputes between the fleet and the processing factories, institutional inertia within the public sphere and finally a decoupling of the entire model. This article outlines how deep-sea trawling originally gained acceptance in the political landscape, how it developed over the years (1950–2013) and how the technological development finally was uncoupled from the needs of the processing industry. The article explains this development through the idea of technological changes as socially constructed and modified, emphasizing that successful technological transformations have to be in line with basic social values and perceptions.},

abstract = {Until the 1990s fisheries were largely managed by the state. Since then, Dutch government and the sector increasingly recognized that a fishing industry cannot be managed effectively without the cooperation and participation of fishers to formulate policy and to implement and enforce laws and regulations. As a result, in the nineties, the existing neo-corporatist arrangement was replaced by a co-management system in the Dutch flatfish fishery. Co-management is often seen as leading to greater procedural legitimacy and subsequently compliance. However, constructing an effective co-management arrangement is not only a matter of building institutions but also a matter of building trust relations between the government and industry. Institutional arrangements such as co-management can contribute to these trust building processes; however, a too strong reliance on institutional arrangements can lead to distrust when new challenges are being faced and institutional arrangements fail to adapt to these changes. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

These two fishing methods are fundamentally different and have different economic, environmental, and even social effects. In this paper we present a hybrid-simulation framework to assess the impact of changing the ratio between cod quota allocated to vessels with longlines and vessels with bottom trawls. It makes use of conventional bioeconomic models and discrete event modelling and provides a framework for simulating life cycle assessment (LCA) for a cod fishery. The model consists of two submodels, a system dynamics model describing the biological aspect of the fishery and a discrete event model for fishing activities. The model was run multiple times for different quota allocation scenarios and results are presented where different scenarios are presented in the three dimensions of sustainability: environmental, social, and economic. The optimal allocation strategy depends on weighing the three different factors. The results were encouraging first-steps towards a useful modelling method but the study would benefit greatly from better data on fishing activities.},

These indicators enhance the analytical capabilities within NOAA Fisheries for conducting fisheries social impact assessments and informing ecosystem-based fishery management. Building on the existing Community Social Vulnerability Indicators (CSVIs), new measures of climate change vulnerability are defined for the U.S. Eastern and Gulf coasts. These new indicators are used to assess the impact of sea level rise on critical commercial fishing infrastructure and the dependence of communities on species identified as vulnerable to the effects of climate change. Examples are provided in this article to demonstrate the utility of these new indicators to policy makers and the NOAA strategic goal for building resilient coastal communities that are environmentally and economically sustainable. Integration of CSVIs and the new climate change vulnerability indices highlight community needs for unique solutions in order to adapt to environmental and social changes and maintain their well-being.},

Further, one third of the products carried health benefit claim, one third taste benefit claim, and one third no additional claim FOP. Attention to information and its effect on experienced taste, health perception and the buying intention were measured. The results show that the message displayed FOP altered consumers evaluation and choice. The effectiveness of the FOP message further depended on consumers' health motivation and the healthfulness perception of carrier products. The outcomes are summarized in a framework of health-pleasure trade-off. Current findings call for the establishment of standards to avoid the use of misleading information FOP.},

abstract = {It is commonly assumed that sensory impairments occurring with age negatively affect older people's intake of foods in terms of both quality and quantity. This review discusses evidence published on the effects of age on sensory perception and the consequences for independently living seniors' perception, liking and intake of food products. Because of anatomical changes in all the senses involved in human food perception, on average seniors perceive a lower flavour intensity than younger adults, are less sensitive to changes in the flavour profile of foods, and show a decreased ability to discriminate between different intensity levels of flavour and/or taste attributes. However, despite these differences in their sensory perception of foods, young adults and seniors seem to differ less in their initial hedonic appraisal of food products. Nonetheless, more research is needed to determine whether multisensory enrichment of foods across different modalities may lead to increased food liking in seniors both with and without olfactory impairment. Although limited, the current evidence suggests that sensory performance may be positively associated with BMI or body weight in specific senior populations. In addition, seniors fail to show a decreased appreciation of an eaten food, thereby increasing the risk of a monotonous diet. Taken together, these findings highlight the need for appropriate interventions and/or foods to improve and maintain adequate quantity and quality of food intake among independently living seniors, and especially those with low sensory performance. Such interventions should be holistic rather than focused on one modality and may also incorporate hedonic modulators such as past experiences, affective factors and external cues, e.g. brand names, labels or food packaging. In interventions and product development, segmentation of the senior consumer market is strongly advised to identify more homogeneous subgroups in order to deal with the large heterogeneity between independently living seniors. It is concluded that one size of the silver food experience will most likely not fit all senior consumers!},

@article{Stewart2013,
abstract = {Many fisheries stock assessment models are implemented specifically for likelihood-based estimation or for Bayesian inference (via full integration of the joint posterior distributions), but not all have appropriate structure for both statistical approaches. Bias correction of recruitment deviations, in particular, must be adjusted to achieve consistency in each case. Fisheries management often uses the two types of results similarly, setting future catch quotas based on expected values or posterior medians depending on which is available given time constraints. Using two recent examples from the U.S. west coast, Pacific hake and sablefish, both implemented in Stock Synthesis, we find that likelihood-based estimates of key management quantities, such as spawning biomass, corresponded well with posterior modes, but tend to be lower (on an absolute scale) than posterior median values and that the asymptotic approximation for uncertainty intervals based on the Hessian matrix tends to overestimate the likelihood of smaller stock sizes and underestimate that of larger stock sizes. This pattern may be caused by a basic asymmetry in most fisheries data-sets: the necessity of a minimum stock size to have generated the observed catch/time-series, but little information regarding the plausibility among much larger stock sizes. Where only one type of inference is available, this asymmetry may be important for management decision-making. Even if management takes explicit account of uncertainty, in some cases adding a precautionary buffer that scales with the relative uncertainty in point estimates, the differences in catch advice may turn out to be important and the relative reductions non-linear. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

abstract = {This paper comments and discusses the article ‘Evaluating the influence of candidate terrestrial protected areas on coral reef condition in Fiji׳ by Klein et al. in Marine Policy 44 2014. Klein et al. integrate land-sea planning by optimising the design of Fiji׳s expanded protected area network to benefit coral reefs, while maintaining a terrestrial network that is representative of Fiji׳s various terrestrial ecosystems. They discuss the benefits of various spatial conservation models compared to a candidate protected area network proposed by Fiji׳s Protected Area Committee (FPAC), which is based on expert knowledge and a scoring system. This paper argues that their analyses are best interpreted as the FPAC network outperforming the models proposed by Klein et al. in protecting terrestrial biodiversity. The FPAC network performs better because it includes data that was not available for spatial modelling, especially the percentage of endemic species per ecosystem and the practicalities of protecting an area earmarked for conservation. This suggests that expert knowledge can be an important resource for conservation planning, especially in developing countries, and that spatial conservation planning should harness this knowledge.},

abstract = {Effective management of artisanal fisheries requires understanding fishers, their behaviors, and the drivers that underpin their choices. Behavioral drivers are critical links in understanding the interactions between social and ecological systems and can help inform effective management approaches. A Bayesian Belief Network modeling approach was used to investigate a diverse range of qualitative and quantitative social and ecological drivers of spatial location choice in a multi-species artisanal dive fishery in Costa Rica. Empirical and observer data used to populate the BBN showed the influence of economic factors, environmental conditions as well as social interactions on the decision-making process of spatial location choice. Good governance scenarios represented by Responsible Fisheries Marine Areas Management were analyzed for both hookah and free diving methods to assess the effects of responsible fishing on the fishers and the fishery. Model based-scenario analysis suggests that management interventions should consider the fisher's potential behavioral responses in the context of environmental variability, dependence on cultural assets, and food security. The results show that there is a need to understand fisher's decisions based on broad socio-ecological system understanding and consider the environmental outcomes alongside food security and the cultural significance of different marine species to fishing communities.},

abstract = {This chapter describes highly detailed modeling of existing coal-fired units in the US power sector within the FACETS TIMES model. Such detailed modeling is necessary wherever the existing stock plays a key role in determining policy cost. The soon-to-be-implemented Mercury and Air Toxics (MATS) regulation imposes unit-level emissions rate constraints on nearly 1100 coal-fired units, forcing retrofit or retire decisions at a large portion of the existing fleet. Covered emissions and retrofit costs depend in a detailed way on unit configuration and coal quality, forcing development of new techniques to handle the enormous expansion in model size and detail. These retrofit/retire decisions are being made under uncertainty about future carbon policies for the sector. FACETS was used to compare “foresight” scenarios in which the model could “see” both the MATS requirements and a power sector clean energy standard (CES) to “myopic” scenarios in which the MATS decisions made in the Reference scenario are fixed in the model solution up through the MATS compliance window in model year 2018, after which the model is free to begin responding to the CES. The overall national costs of myopia were found to be small, except when the carbon policy ramps up very quickly after air quality compliance decisions are made, but significant regional heterogeneity exists. Stranded asset costs from retrofitted units that must be underutilized or abandoned later range from {\$}2 to 8 billion in the myopic cases. Substantially fewer retrofits are undertaken in the foresight cases, reducing stranded asset costs in some regions by up to 100 {\%}.},

abstract = {The European Union is aiming to implement an Ecosystem Approach for the management of all human activities in the marine environment, hereunder the fisheries sector. Since the last reform of the Common Fisheries Policy in 2013, several analyses have highlighted the barriers and challenges to this aim. Despite the claim that much of the framework to support the implementation of an EAFM in Europe is in place, the findings point out to deterrent features within the governance system. Beyond the overall policy framework, this paper explores the implementation of the multiannual multispecies management plans as one of the real moves towards Ecosystem Approach to Fisheries Management. This is carried out on the basis of two case studies that address the design of multiannual multispecies management plans for the Baltic Sea and for the Atlantic Pelagic fisheries. The analyses strengthen with empirical evidences our understanding of the challenges ahead including, among others, an institutional gap between fisheries and environmental policy frameworks resulting in a limited integration of broader environmental concerns in one of the proposed plan and the standoff between decision-makers that delays the adoption and use of proposed management plans and creates frustration for the involved agencies.},

@misc{Gordon2001,
abstract = {The deep sea is often thought of as a cold, dark and uniform environment with a low-fish biomass, much of which is highly adapted for life in a food-poor environment. While this might be true of the pelagic fish living in the water column, it is certainly not true of the demersal fish which live on or close to the bottom on the continental slopes around the British Isles (the Atlantic Frontier). These fish are currently being commercially exploited. There is growing evidence to support the view that success of the demersal fish assemblages depends on the pelagic or benthopelagic food sources that impinge both vertically and horizontally onto the slope. There are several quite separate and distinct deep-water fisheries on the Atlantic Frontier. It is a physical barrier, the Wyville-Thomson Ridge, which results in the most significant division of the fisheries. The Ridge, which has a minimum depth of about 500 m, separates the warmer deep Atlantic waters from the much colder Norwegian Sea water and as a result, the deep-water fisheries to the west of the Hebrides and around the offshore banks are quite different from those of the Faroe-Shetland Channel (West of Shetland). The fisheries to the West of the Hebrides can be further divided by the fishing method used into bottom trawl, semipelagic trawl and longline. The bottom-trawl fisheries extend from the shelf-slope break down to about 1700m and the target species varies with depth. The smallest vessels in the fleet fish on the upper slope, where an important target species is the anglerfish or monkfish (Lophius spp.). On the mid-slope the main target species are blue ling (Molva dypterygia) and roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), with bycatches of black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo) and deep-water sharks. On the lower slope orange roughy (Hoplostethus atlanticus) is an important target species. The major semipelagic trawl fishery is a seasonal fishery on spawning aggregations of blue whiting (Micromesistius poutassou). The other semipelagic fishery is on spawning aggregations of the greater silver smelt or argentine (Argentina silus). Spanish and UK vessels that target mainly hake (Merluccius merluccius) and a Norwegian fleet that targets ling (Molva molva), blue ling and tusk (Brosme brosme) dominate the upper slope longline fishery. West of Shetland, the fishery on the upper slope has some similarities with that of the Hebridean slope, with anglerfish and blue ling being important target species. A quite different fishery occurs in the transition zone between the Atlantic and Norwegian Sea waters. Here the main target species is Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides). Below the transition zone biomass decreases rapidly and there is no fishery. It is generally agreed that many deep-water species have slow growth, a high age at first maturity and a low fecundity, which makes them vulnerable to over-exploitation. Other features of these fishes such as high mortality of discards and escapees will add to the problems. Despite this the only management procedures in place are general limitation of effort measures within the area of jurisdiction of the European Union. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.},

The identification of the separate effects that the two factors have on costs is not common in the literature. Three Norwegian fleets fishing Norwegian spring spawning herring (Clupea Harengus) and five Norwegian fleets fishing Northeast Arctic cod (Gadus Morhua) are evaluated. The findings indicate that variable unit costs fall in output in both fisheries. The results also show that variable unit costs fall in fish stock in the demersal fishery, but with a stock elasticity of variable unit costs in absolute terms significantly less than 1. These results are of relevance to a manager seeking the optimal harvest rule and to understand fishermen's incentives when individual vessel quotas are reduced.},

There is a growing dependence on market-based approaches that in turn rely on healthy, functioning markets to achieve economic outcomes. As well, social goals of equity and fairness in fisheries have re-emerged as priorities alongside the goals of ecological sustainability and economic efficiency. This study aims to address the past and present state of the concentration of fishing licenses in British Columbia's salmon and herring fisheries. Fisheries administrative data from federal and provincial data sets were mined to develop a timeline of fisheries ownership and control over a twenty-year period. Hidden corporate ownership of licenses through subsidiaries was identified and comprehensive criteria were co-identified with industry representatives to characterize the various user groups of fisheries licenses. Our analysis suggests that from 1993 to 2012, there was a notable shift in the ownership profile of salmon and herring licenses, with a marked increase in concentration of licenses owned by fish processors.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the conceptual background and application of technical reference points in fishery management. Despite considerable investment in stock assessment methodology and expertise, fisheries worldwide are overexploited. This appears to be due to a mismatch between the precision of assessment and the precision of management. Two types of reference points are recognized: target reference points (TRPs) and limit reference points (LRPs). The use of MSY as a target reference point is considered in the light of past performance of fishery management, and it is suggested that MSY and other reference points formerly used as targets, may be more appropriately applied as LRPs. The recent trend towards the quantification of uncertainty and estimation of risk in the provision of advice is considered to be good, but the cost and availability of information and expertise required may preclude the use of these techniques for many small or low value stocks and for most stocks in developing countries. The recent trend towards inclusion of ‘ecosystem concepts' in setting fishery management objectives is also seen as good, and overdue. Although still in their formative stages, ecosystem concepts can still provide LRPs. Effective management will require a ‘set of rules' comprising both TRPs and LRPs. In most national and international fishery management situations, the current institutional structure will probably require some modification in order to successfully apply these sets of rules. Fisheries management organizations will continue to assess and manage fisheries routinely, but management may need to develop an independent review which comes into play when resource production limits are approached. The action to be taken at such limits should be discussed and agreed in advance.},

abstract = {In regular statistical models, the leave-one-out cross-validation is asymptotically equivalent to the Akaike information criterion. However, since many learning machines are singular statistical models, the asymptotic behavior of the cross-validation remains unknown. In previous studies, we established the singular learning theory and proposed a widely applicable information criterion, the expectation value of which is asymptotically equal to the average Bayes generalization loss. In the present paper, we theoretically compare the Bayes cross-validation loss and the widely applicable information criterion and prove two theorems. First, the Bayes cross-validation loss is asymptotically equivalent to the widely applicable information criterion as a random variable. Therefore, model selection and hyperparameter optimization using these two values are asymptotically equivalent. Second, the sum of the Bayes generalization error and the Bayes cross-validation error is asymptotically equal to {\$}2\backslashlambda/n{\$}, where {\$}\backslashlambda{\$} is the real log canonical threshold and {\$}n{\$} is the number of training samples. Therefore the relation between the cross-validation error and the generalization error is determined by the algebraic geometrical structure of a learning machine. We also clarify that the deviance information criteria are different from the Bayes cross-validation and the widely applicable information criterion.},

abstract = {Census data on endangered species are often sparse, error-ridden, and confined to only a segment of the population. Estimating trends and extinction risks using this type of data presents numerous difficulties. In particular, the estimate of the variation in year-to-year transitions in population size (the "process error" caused by stochasticity in survivorship and fecundities) is confounded by the addition of high sampling error variation. In addition, the year-to-year variability in the segment of the population that is sampled may be quite different from the population variability that one is trying to estimate. The combined effect of severe sampling error and age- or stage-specific counts leads to severe biases in estimates of population-level parameters. I present an estimation method that circumvents the problem of age- or stage-specific counts and is markedly robust to severe sampling error. This method allows the estimation of environmental variation and population trends for extinction-risk analyses using corrupted census counts-a common type of data for endangered species that has hitherto been relatively unusable for these analyses.},

This overview describes the internal structure of the Earth together with the heat transfer mechanisms inside mantle and crust. It also shows the location of geothermal fields on specific areas of the Earth. The Earth's heat flow and geothermal gradient are defined, as well as the types of geothermal fields, the geologic environment of geothermal energy, and the methods of exploration for geothermal resources including drilling and resource assessment. Geothermal energy, as natural steam and hot water, has been exploited for decades to generate electricity, and both in space heating and industrial processes. The geothermal electrical installed capacity in the world is 7974 MWe (year 2000), and the electrical energy generated is 49.3 billion kWh/year, representing 0.3 {\%} of the world total electrical energy which was 15,342 billion kWh in 2000. In developing countries, where total installed electrical power is still low, geothermal energy can play a significant role: in the Philippines 21{\%} of electricity comes from geothermal steam, 20{\%} in El Salvador, 17{\%} in Nicaragua, 10{\%} in Costa Rica and 8{\%} in Kenya. Electricity is produced with an efficiency of 10–17{\%}. The geothermal kWh is generally cost-competitive with conventional sources of energy, in the range 2–10 UScents/kWh, and the geothermal electrical capacity installed in the world (1998) was 1/5 of that from biomass, but comparable with that from wind sources. The thermal capacity in non-electrical uses (greenhouses, aquaculture, district heating, industrial processes) is 15,14 MWt (year 2000). Financial investments in geothermal electrical and non-electrical uses world-wide in the period 1973–1992 were estimated at about US{\$}22,000 million. Present technology makes it possible to control the environmental impact of geothermal exploitation, and an effective and easily implemented policy to encourage geothermal energy development, and the abatement of carbon dioxide emissions would take advantage from the imposition of a carbon tax. The future use of geothermal energy from advanced technologies such as the exploitation of hot dry rock/hot wet rock systems, magma bodies and geopressured reservoirs, is briefly discussed. While the viability of hot dry rock technology has been proven, research and development are still necessary for the other two sources. A brief discussion on training of specialists, geothermal literature, on-line information, and geothermal associations concludes the review.},

The original purpose of the UOF's implementation was to reduce the government's financial burden by increasing cost efficiency in higher education institutions. By nature, the UOF differs from the traditional governmental budget regimes in three major respects. First of all, institutional operations and programs are no longer fully funded by government appropriations. Secondly, the universities can now retain surplus resources. Finally, the regulations on the use of funds raised by each institution itself are now less cumbersome. These differences provide universities with incentives for higher cost-efficiency and more active fund-raising. The empirical results from our study, which are based on panel data gathered from 34 public universities during the academic years 1992-2000, suggest that the adoption of the UOF has had a significantly negative impact on cost efficiency. ?? 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {This study aimed to find out how “free-from labelling” shapes consumers' perception of food products and whether the absence of an ingredient is considered an indicator of improved nutritional value of the product. An online survey was conducted in four European countries: the United Kingdom, Sweden, Poland, and France (overall N = 1950). Four “free-from labels” (lactose-free, gluten-free, GMO-free, and palm oil-free) were tested using different product categories that these labels typically appear on. Healthiness perception was evaluated by comparing products with the free-from labels to identical products without the labels. Potential predictors for healthiness evaluation and intention to pay a price premium were assessed, including nutrition knowledge, information-seeking on food packages, preference for food naturalness, general health interest, trust in actors in the food domain, and affect regarding the absent ingredients. Products with a free-from label were considered healthier than products without such a label, with the strongest effects occurring for labels indicating that products were free of GMOs and free of palm oil. Some differences were observed among countries in the evaluation of the product-label combinations. Information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and affect were significant predictors of healthiness evaluation. Furthermore, healthiness evaluation, information-seeking, nutrition knowledge, and preference for naturalness predicted intention to pay a price premium for products labelled free-from. When shaping consumers' food shopping behaviour using certain food labels, it is important to know how consumers interpret those labels. A false interpretation of labels might lead to unintended changes in consumer behaviour.},

abstract = {Coastal and ocean planning comprises a broad field of practice. The goals, political processes, and approaches applied to planning initiatives may vary widely. However, all planning processes ultimately require adequate information on both the biophysical and social attributes of a planning region. In coastal and ocean planning practice, there are well-established methods to assess biophysical attributes; however, less is understood about the role and assessment of social data. We conducted the first global assessment of the incorporation of social data in coastal and ocean planning. We drew on a comprehensive review of planning initiatives and a survey of coastal and ocean practitioners. There was significantly more incorporation of social data in multiuse versus conservation-oriented planning. Practitioners engaged a wide range of social data, including governance, economic, and cultural attributes of planning regions and human impacts data. Less attention was given to ecosystem services and social-ecological linkages, both of which could improve coastal and ocean planning practice. Although practitioners recognize the value of social data, little funding is devoted to its collection and incorporation in plans. Increased capacity and sophistication in acquiring critical social and ecological data for planning is necessary to develop plans for more resilient coastal and ocean ecosystems and communities. We suggest that improving social data monitoring, and in particular spatial social data, to complement biophysical data, is necessary for providing holistic information for decision-support tools and other methods. Moving beyond people as impacts to people as beneficiaries, through ecosystem services assessments, holds much potential to better incorporate the tenets of ecosystem-based management into coastal and ocean planning by providing targets for linked biodiversity conservation and human welfare outcomes.

abstract = {This study proposes a political interference hypothesis to explain how political considerations depress the performance of government banks. We define political interference as a situation in which government bank executives are replaced within 12. months after the country's major elections (presidential or parliamentary elections). We classify political and non-political government banks as those that experience or do not experience political interference, respectively. The hypothesis firstly suggests that once government banks undertake political interference, their financial performance deteriorates. That is, political banks display the worst performance, followed by non-political banks and private banks have the best performance. Next, we posit that the impact of political interference is greater in developing countries than in developed countries. Finally, we hypothesize that the underperformance of government banks will be reduced if we remove political interference. By employing bank data from 65 countries from the period of 2003-2007, our hypothesis effectively explains why government banks in developed countries escape relatively unscathed, while those in developing countries suffer significantly. ?? 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {Atlantic Canadian fisheries policy exhibits a tension between competing objectives of economic efficiency, and of well-being and equity within coastal communities and small-scale fisheries. The struggle between different actors over these objectives has generated distinct forms of neoliberalism in different regions and fishing fleets. In the lobster fishery, the right to fish has been concentrated since limited-entry licensing policy was introduced in the 1980s. This paper examines actors and events at two scales, including Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34 Advisory Committee meetings involving fishermen, representatives of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and other stakeholders, and broader scale strategies of the Canadian Independent Fish Harvesters Federation (CIFHF). A Foucauldian perspective aids in understanding how fisheries governance is the product of struggles between the power and agency of individual fishermen, fishing organizations, processing companies, the DFO, the Minister of Fisheries and the courts. While many theorists view fisheries through the lens of the “tragedy of the commons”, alternative tragedies are developing in Atlantic Canadian fisheries. These include rising levels of debt, reduced earnings, vulnerability to financial volatility, loss of fishing rights within communities, and too much processor control.},

abstract = {Uncertainties in fisheries arise in three principal forms: random fluctuations, uncertainty in parameter estimates and states of nature, and structural uncertainty that reflects a basic lack of knowledge about the nature of the fishery system. The first two of these have been addressed quantitatively through a variety of analytical tools, reviewed briefly in this paper. On the other hand, structural uncertainty poses a greater challenge; having proven rather immune to analytical treatment, it appears to be best addressed through the design of fishery management itself, to ensure that such management is robust, adaptive and precautionary. The paper discusses the nature of these three management characteristics, and illustrates their importance through an analysis of Atlantic Canada's groundfish fishery and its collapse in the early 1990s. The groundfishery is also used as a case study for exploring the extent to which fishery institutions provide a framework for `living with uncertainty'; specifically, an analysis is provided of fishery management and conservation institutions (notably the Fisheries Resource Conservation Council) that have been established in response to the groundfish collapse.},

abstract = {During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it has come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It should be a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting-the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, and Jerome Friedman are professors of statistics at Stanford University. They are prominent researchers in this area: Hastie and Tibshirani developed generalized additive models and wrote a popular book of that title. Hastie wrote much of the statistical modeling software in S-PLUS and invented principal curves and surfaces. Tibshirani proposed the Lasso and is co-author of the very successful An Introduction to the Bootstrap. Friedman is the co-inventor of many data-mining tools including CART, MARS, and projection pursuit. FROM THE REVIEWS: TECHNOMETRICS "This is a vast and complex book. Generally, it concentrates on explaining why and how the methods work, rather than how to use them.

abstract = {Fishery resources, unlike minerals and fossil fuels, are renewable in the sense that they are capable of growth. Unlike forests and most other renewable resources, fishery resources are difficult to manage effectively because they are, with few exceptions, a common property. Most fish, particularly finfish, are very mobile and are not readily observable except upon capture. Consequently, it becomes very difficult or very costly to assign rights of exclusive use to individuals or small groups. The importance of the economics of fisheries management has grown substantially over the past years as a consequence of the United Nations Third Conference on the Law of the Sea. The Conference has brought about a near revolution in the management of world fisheries. Fishery resources constitute common-property resources with the consequence that fisheries are subject to a market failure. A major development in fisheries economics is the shift away from static to dynamic or capital-theoretic analysis. Dynamic considerations, in turn, lead naturally to a consideration of problems arising from uncertainty.},

abstract = {It is often assumed that assessments based on commercial catch and effort data, such as a virtual population analysis, will track trends in abundance more accurately than assessments produced by research surveys. Catch and effort data from a fishery provide information on the fish that were caught. For many fisheries, assessments based on catch data, even those incorporating survey data, are quite variable and may give a misleading picture of the health of the entire stock. Though abundance estimates generated by marine surveys are also variable, they often appear to track abundance trends more accurately than techniques that use catch data. Some statistical methods for analyzing survey data are briefly reviewed and comparative case studies of the assessments of the Newfoundland northern cod stock, the Namibian hake stocks, and Barents Sea cod and haddock are presented. Given the uncertainties inherent in a catch based assessment, it is concluded that surveys should be used to generate an assessment independent of catch statistics as a check of the catch based estimates.},

abstract = {The public perception of fisheries is that they are in crisis and have been for some time. Numerous scientific and popular articles have pointed to the failures of fisheries management that have caused this crisis. These are widely accepted to be overcapacity in fishing fleets, a failure to take the ecosystem effects of fishing into account, and a failure to enforce unpalatable but necessary reductions in fishing effort on fishing fleets and communities. However, the claims of some analysts that there is an inevitable decline in the status of fisheries is, we believe, incorrect. There have been successes in fisheries management, and we argue that the tools for appropriate management exist. Unfortunately, they have not been implemented widely. Our analysis suggests that management authorities need to develop legally enforceable and tested harvest strategies, coupled with appropriate rights-based incentives to the fishing community, for the future of fisheries to be better than their past.},

Further, catch-and-effort data provided by the fishing industry were used to calculate standardized landings per unit effort. The results suggested different trends over time for three deep-water stocks exploited by the same fleet.

Generally understood as the direct marketing of seafood through pre-arranged deliveries, CSFs have increased in number and geographic distribution since their origin in 2007. Despite, or because of, this rapid growth, fundamental questions remain unanswered about what organizational structures and business practices currently constitute the term ‘CSF'. This research draws on interview data from 22 CSFs to highlight the diversity within the CSF movement and inform ongoing debates about appropriate paths for their continued growth. Interview data is used to describe key areas of convergence and divergence among the goals, business practices, and structures of CSFs. Three general types of CSF are identified based on this analysis: harvester focused, consumer focused and species focused. Each type is described through a short illustrative case study. Overall results indicate that the term ‘CSF' does not currently refer to a specific structure or type of organization, but rather an approach to seafood marketing used by a variety of organizations with broadly similar production philosophies centered on engaging and informing consumers around traceable, domestically sourced seafood. Acknowledgment of CSFs as diverse and socially embedded organizations is necessary to understanding their potential benefits.},

abstract = {rapfish is a new multi-disciplinary rapid appraisal technique for evaluating the comparative sustainability of fisheries. For the purpose of this analysis, fisheries may be defined flexibly as entities with a broad scope, such as all the fisheries in a lake, or with narrower scope, such as those in a single jurisdiction, target species, gear type or vessel. A set of fisheries may be compared, or the time trajectories of individual fisheries may be plotted. Attributes are chosen to reflect sustainability within each discipline, and although intended to remain fixed for all analyses, may be refined or substituted as improved information becomes available. Ordinations of sets of attributes are performed using multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) followed by scaling and rotation. Ordinations are anchored by fixed reference points that simulate the best and worst possible fisheries using extremes of the attribute scores, while other anchors secure the ordination in a second axis normal to the first. Randomly scored reference points act as anchors and define significant differences. Separate rapfish ordinations may be performed in ecological, economic, ethical, social and technological disciplines: a further evaluation field expresses compliance with the FAO Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries. Monte Carlo simulation can be used to estimate errors, while the leverage of each attribute on scores can be estimated with a stepwise procedure. Status results may be expressed on a scale from 0 to 100{\%}, and scores from several fields may be combined in kite diagrams to facilitate comparison of fisheries or fisheries constructed to represent alternative policies. Some validations of the methodology are presented, using simulated fishery data. Results from published work using rapfish are reviewed briefly, along with prospects for further improvements to the technique.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright}2017 John Wiley {\&} Sons Ltd. We present a framework for results-based management (RBM) of commercial fisheries. The core idea of RBM is to reduce micromanagement by delegating management responsibility to resource users. The RBM framework represents an industrial organization approach to co-management and comprises three defining processes, conducted by three independent “agents“: (i) an “authority“ defines specific and measurable and achievable objectives (outcome targets, OTs) for the utilization of fisheries resources, (ii) resource user organizations (termed “operators“) take responsibility for achieving these OTs and provide documentation that (iii) allows independent “auditors“ to evaluate the achievement of OTs. Using incentive mechanisms, notably deregulation, RBM grants operators the flexibility to develop and implement innovative and cost-effective ways to achieve OTs. The feasibility of implementing RBM in five European fisheries was investigated in cooperation with relevant stakeholders through artificial planning processes and computer simulations. The operators involved were enthusiastic, and new management plans were drafted based on the framework. These included socioeconomic OTs in addition to traditional stock objectives, encompassing an ecosystem approach. Several issues are in need of further research to consolidate the approach and prepare the ground for practical implementation, including: the specification of the legal and regulatory framework required to underpin RBM, details of transitional arrangements when shifting towards RBM (including cost-sharing) and the development of necessary organizational capacity for operators. Initially, we therefore envisage the framework being applied to high-value single-species fisheries, with a limited number of participants, which are adequately represented by a competent organization.},

The use of health claims is regulated and the regulation requires that the average consumer is able to understand the health claims, as means to protect consumers from misleading claims. Due to the technical terms used in the authorised health claims and the potential of such claims to mislead consumers, attempts to improve consumer understanding of health claims are relevant. The aim of this study was to elicit the inferences that consumers make from different variations of a beta-glucans health claim in order to gain an understanding of how consumers' understanding of health claims can be improved. Two methods for elicitation of inferences, the Consumer Understanding Test (CUT) and laddering interviews, were applied in a study conducted among consumers (N=295) in Denmark. Re-wording an authorised health claim or adding information did not improve understanding and could even decrease consumers' understanding of the claim. Several implications of these findings are discussed.},

abstract = {Marine populations in Europe are in decline due to the unsuccessful results of the Common Fisheries Policy. By combining data of scientific recommendations from ICES, TACs approved and reported landings with an age-structured model, the objectives of this paper are to investigate the level of compliance of the TAC regulation, and the level of enforcement and its economic impact on fishery resources. The results presented here suggest that while there does not exist a regular pattern between TAC proposal and TAC approved, there is a clear pattern between TAC approved and reported landings. As a consequence, there is a regular lack of enforcement at national fisheries authority level. The paper also presents results of the recovery plans for the Southern hake and the Atlantic cod fisheries as case studies to illustrate the level of enforcement based on collusion between national fisheries advisers and industry. The results from both cases studies analyzed here indicate that drastic solutions could generate positive results for the recovery of the stocks, but perhaps they are not always the best measure in fisheries management due to the high economic losses for fishermen and social effects on coastal communities in the short and medium term. Finally, this work demonstrates that if the recovery plans had been implemented, the net present profits for both fisheries would have increased over time.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T A large gap has been identified between the current and optimal economic performance of wild-capture commercial fisheries in Australia. Economic approaches have the potential to assist fisheries to bridge this gap, such as bio-economic models that combine biology with fishing costs to evaluate the economic performance of a broad range of management measures. Economic objectives are prevalent in overarching Australian fisheries legislation, however economic data is often not collected and economic analyses or instruments not broadly applied. This paper reviews selected Australian fisheries to demonstrate the accrued economic benefits from applying formal bio-economic models and conducting empirical analyses of the impact of supply on product value. Challenges to the implementation and continued use of economic analyses and instruments are discussed including: (i) short-term transition costs and associated trade-offs between ecological, economic, social and political objectives; (ii) scarce logistical and financial capacity to collect and analyse economic data; (iii) a lack of desire among industry to change and transition to economic targets such as maximum economic yield (MEY), particularly when it is associated with lower catches; and (iv) a lack of economic literacy among fisheries managers and industry. It is contended that many of these challenges initially arise from an absence of clearly identified and prioritised objectives within overarching legislation and management plans. Once objectives are prioritised, limited resources can be allocated more efficiently to improve data collection, economic analysis and increase awareness as well as education of managers and industry.},

abstract = {In May 2010 the New England Fishery Management Council introduced a catch share, program in the Northeast Multispecies (groundfish) Fishery. Amendment 16 of the Northeast Multispecies Fishery Management Plan allocated quota to 17 self organized groups of permit holders based on their collective catch history. These groups are commonly referred to as Sectors and are similar to harvest cooperatives. Sectors represented a significant shift from previous management approaches reliant on limits to days at sea and other input controls. Given the potential for significant social and economic effects of catch shares and other management programs, social and economic performance measures were developed from 2009 to 2010 by Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) social scientists. Previous social and economic monitoring of management outcomes had been ad hoc and provided minimal opportunity for inter-fishery comparison. This paper describes the process of identifying performance measures and associated indicators to serve as the foundation of monitoring social and economic outcomes for all federal fisheries in the U.S. Northeast Region, and for planning NEFSC social and economic research priorities. It then presents how these performance measures were applied to assess the first year of the Amendment 16 Sector program. Challenges and limitations of this process are presented along with a description of efforts underway to broaden the use of these social and economic metrics to other fisheries. {\textcopyright}2013 Published by Elsevier Ltd.},

Particular attention is paid to the valuation and specification of in situ common-property resources in a neoclassical production technology, catchability of the resource, and variations in economic capacity utilization. An empirical analysis of the open-access Pacific coast trawl fishing industry demonstrates that disentangling the productivity residual from changes in resource abundance, its catchability, and variations in capacity utilization hones the productivity residual to finer precision, lowering mean productivity growth by about half. Removing biological noise from highly variable resources is also important. The results are related to a program limiting the number of vessels and can contribute to sustainable resource management whenever resources are held in common. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

@article{Kempf2016,
abstract = {One of the most important goals in current fisheries management is to maintain or restore stocks above levels that can produce the maximum sustainable yield (MSY). However, it may not be feasible to achieve MSY simultaneously for multiple species because of trade-offs that result from interactions between species, mixed fisheries and the multiple objectives of stakeholders. The premise in this study is that MSY is a concept that needs adaptation, not wholesale replacement. The approach chosen to identify trade-offs and stakeholder preferences involved a process of consulting and discussing options with stakeholders as well as scenario modelling with bio-economic and multi-species models. It is difficult to intuitively anticipate the consequences of complex trade-offs and it is also complicated to address them from a political point of view. However, scenario modelling showed that the current approach of treating each stock separately and ignoring trade-offs may result in unacceptable ecosystem, economic or social effects in North Sea fisheries. Setting FMSY as a management target without any flexibility for compromises may lead to disappointment for some of the stakeholders. To treat FMSY no longer as a point estimate but rather as a “Pretty Good Yield” within sustainable ranges was seen as a promising way forward to avoid unacceptable outcomes when trying to fish all stocks simultaneously at FMSY. This study gives insights on how inclusive governance can help to reach consensus in difficult political processes, and how science can be used to make informed decisions inside a multi-dimensional trade-off space.},

abstract = {It is common practice for airlines to charge several different fares for a common pool of scats. This paper presents a model that has been used to address the problem of when to refuse booking requests for a given fare level to save the seat for a potential request at a higher fare level. This model assumes that lower fare passengers book before higher fare passengers book. This occurs quite frequently in practice, where lower fare passengers are usually vacationers and higher fare passengers are usually business travelers. In fact, many airlines mandate this practice by imposing advance booking requirements on lower fare classes to prevent business travelers from using them, We present an algorithm that finds a seat management policy that maximizes mean revenue by establishing a critical value for each fare class. Booking requests for a particular fare level are accepted if the number of empty seats is strictly greater than its critical value and rejected otherwise. This critical value is a decreasing function of the fare price and is equal to zero for the class with the highest fare. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Regardless of the method used to obtain point estimates, a method is required for variance estimation. A bootstrap technique is introduced for the evaluation of uncertainty in such models, taking into account inherent spatial and temporal correlations in the datasets, which are commonly transferred as assumptions from a likelihood estimation procedure into Hessian-based variance estimation procedures. The technique is demonstrated on a real dataset and the effects of the number of bootstrap samples on estimation bias and variance estimates are studied. Although the modelling framework and bootstrap method can be applied to multispecies and multiarea models, for clarity the case study described is of a single-species and single-area model.},

abstract = {Historically, communities persisted in remote, isolated areas of Alaska in large part because of the abundance of marine and terrestrial resources, as well as the ability of local people to opportunistically access those resources as they became available. Species switching and the ability to shift effort away from fisheries during poor years allowed local residents to diversify their livelihoods in the face of uncertainties and ecological change. The advent of modern fisheries management, which views Alaskan fisheries as the property of all citizens of the United States, has fundamentally altered the relationship of place-based communities to fishery resources. Local access to fisheries has been particularly affected by the development of transferable fishing privileges, making it possible for fishing rights to leave place-based communities through the choices of individual community members to sell or to move away. When fishing communities in Alaska lose active fishing businesses, over time the loss of various types of community capital will follow, including human, social, cultural, technical, and financial capital. In some cases, communities are able to adapt or transform through diversification of their local economies. In other cases, no alternatives to a fishery-based economy are accessible. We have used resilience theory to explore drivers of change affecting Alaskan fishing communities. Emphasis was placed on two primary change drivers, the regulatory environment and rural out-migration, as well as their interconnections and their impacts on individuals, communities, and the larger social-ecological system. We summarized several government programs that have been implemented to support the continued participation of communities in Alaskan fisheries. In addition, we reviewed informal and private-sector efforts to generate resilience strategies that can facilitate new entry into fisheries or retain fishing businesses and fishing rights within communities, as well as respond to increasing uncertainty related to the global market and climate changes.

Using county-level data, we provide new evidence that public relief workers displace other workers, especially in the construction sector. Our review of the previous literature suggests that job training programs have small effects on wages and re-employment in Sweden, but precise inferences are difficult because of small sample sizes. We also investigate alternative reasons for the stability of the Beveridge Curve in Sweden, and compare regional evolutions of employment and unemployment in Sweden and the U.S. Lastly, we present cross-country analysis for 1993 which, contrary to studies that use earlier data, shows that the extent of a country's active labor market programs is positively associated with the national unemployment rate.{\textless}P{\textgreater}(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item.)},

abstract = {Individual transferable quotas (ITQs) have reduced overcapacity and increased profitability in many fisheries, and have sometimes helped to reduce overfishing. ITQs are designed almost entirely on the basis of economic theory, however. This paper assesses ITQs from the viewpoints of four broader analytical frameworks: the interactive governance approach (IGA); the social-ecological systems (SES) framework; the ecosystems approach to fisheries (EAF); and the legal and rights-based paradigm. When viewed from these perspectives, ITQs are seen to involve several real and potential problems. These problems include concentration of ownership and the loss of SSFs; failure to make use of non-economic modes of governance; risk of ecological damage and overexploitation, and unfairness to the public as the owner of the fish.Nevertheless, ITQ schemes can be modified in ways that reduce the potential negative impacts while still retaining the structure and economic advantages. This paper describes four possible changes: reserving quota share for traditional fisheries and/or SSFs; explicitly imposing a duty of stewardship on quota holders; implementing fees or royalties rather than granting ITQs for free; and cooperative regulation. For each proposed change, the problems and weaknesses which it addresses are identified, and the potential effectiveness of the solution is discussed. ?? 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

A case study of Indian banking industry is taken as an example to illustrate the potential application of these two methods of decomposition. Our two broad empirical findings are that first, competition created after financial sector reforms generates high efficiency growth, and reduces excess capacity; second, the cost gap of the short-run cost from the actual cost is higher for the nationalized banks over the private banks indicating that the former banks, though old, do not reflect their learning experience in their cost minimizing behavior. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {This paper is concerned with those actions of business firms which have harmful effects on others. The standard example is that of a factory the smoke from which has harmful effects on those occupying neighboring properties. The economic analysis of such a situation has usually proceeded in terms of a divergence between the private and social product of the factory, in which economists have largely followed the treatment of Pigou in The Economics of Welfare. The conclusions to which this kind of analysis seems to have led most economists is that it would be desirable to make the owner of the factory liable for the damage caused to those injured by the smoke, or alternatively, to place a tax on the factory owner varying with the amount of smoke produced and equivalent in money terms to the damage it would cause, or finally, to exclude the factory from residential districts (and presumably from other areas in which the emission of smoke would have harmful effects on others). It is my contention that the suggested courses of action are inappropriate, in that they lead to results which are not necessarily, or even usually, desirable.},

abstract = {Academia and management agencies show a growing interest for ecosystem-based fishery management (EBFM). However, the way to operationalize this approach remains challenging. The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful for the implementation of EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach. An illustration is proposed, using data on the fisheries of Bay of Biscay (France) exploiting the stocks of nephrops and hake. Stochastic simulations show how CVA can guarantee both ecological (stock) and economic (profit) sustainability. Using 2008 as a baseline, the model is used to identify fishing efforts that ensure such co-viability. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

To do that, they have to be measured along side tangibles whose measurements must also be evaluated as to, how well, they serve the objectives of the decision maker. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is a theory of measurement through pairwise comparisons and relies on the judgements of experts to derive priority scales. It is these scales that measure intangibles in relative terms. The comparisons are made using a scale of absolute judgements that represents, how much more, one element dominates another with respect to a given attribute. The judgements may be inconsistent, and how to measure inconsistency and improve the judgements, when possible to obtain better consistency is a concern of the AHP. The derived priority scales are synthesised by multiplying them by the priority of their parent nodes and adding for all such nodes. An illustration is included.},

abstract = {We compiled 297 series of catch-per-unit-effort (CPUE) and independent abundance data (as estimated by research trawl surveys) and used observation error and random effects models to test the hypothesis that CPUE is proportional to true abundance. We used a power curve, for which we were interested in the shape parameter (beta). There was little difference among species, ages, or gear types in the distributions of the raw estimates of beta for each CPUE series. We examined three groups: cod, flatfish, and gadiformes, finding strong evidence that CPUE was most likely to remain high while abundance declines (i.e., hyperstability, where beta {\textless} 1). The range in the mean of the random effects distribution for beta was quite small, 0.64-0.75. Cod showed the least hyperstability, but still, 76{\%} of the mass of the random effects distribution was below 1. Based on simulations, our estimates of beta are positively biased by approximately 10{\%}; this should be considered in the application of our findings here. We also considered the precision of CPUE indices through a meta-analysis of observation error variances. The most precise indices were those from flatfish (median coefficient of variation of approximately approximate to0.42).},

First, that the interpretation of sustainability in the New Zealand QMS disregards the social while simultaneously accentuating a particularly neoliberal economic paradigm in which sustainability is directed towards sustaining the wealth generating potential of quota holdings. Second, while in theory there is a separation of biological and economic conceptions of sustainability in the QMS, these processes are, in fact, deeply intertwined. Third, that the sustainability brand works to legitimise the privatisation and marketization of marine en-vironments, to protect the income stream of quota investors, and to effectively incorporate and discipline dissent.},

abstract = {The argument persists that the continued overexploitation by many fisheries around the world is evidence that current approaches to fisheries management are failing, and that more precautionary management approaches are needed. We review the available estimates of the status of fish stocks from three sources: the FAO's " State of Marine Resources " , a database on scientific stock assessments, and recent estimates from stat-istical models designed to determine the status of unassessed fish stocks. The two key results are (i) that stocks that are scientifically assessed are in better shape and indeed are not typically declining but rebuilding, and (ii) that large stocks appear to be in better shape than small stocks. These results support the view that stocks that are managed are improving, while stocks that are not managed are not. Large stocks receive far more management attention than small stocks in jurisdictions that have active fisheries management systems, and most unassessed stocks are simply not managed. We assert that fisheries management as currently practised can (and often does) lead to sustainable fisheries, and what is needed is to actively manage the unassessed fisheries of the world. More precautionary management is not necessarily needed to ensure the sus-tainability of managed fisheries.},

abstract = {Can a perishable food commodity with strong seasonal variation in supply, supplied by producers with limited operational radius, belong to a spatially integrated market? The majority of Norwegian cod is landed during a few winter months. Moreover, most of the catch is landed fresh by a fleet consisting primarily of many smaller vessels with limited operational radius. This makes landing patterns and potentially markets regional. However, there are also landings in the remainder of the year, primarily by larger oceangoing vessels such as trawlers with a larger operational radius that may ensure market integration between the regions. Market integration can also be ensured through landings of a potential substitute; frozen cod, which is less perishable. In this paper we investigate the degree of market integration between different regions for fresh cod in Norway, and between fresh and frozen cod. We find that the markets for fresh cod are integrated but not all regions adhere to the Law of One Price. Markets for fresh and frozen cod are also integrated, but not to the extent that the Law of One Price holds. Finally, there is evidence of frozen cod leading the fresh cod prices.},

@article{VanPutten2010,
abstract = {The Tasmanian rock lobster industry has been managed by Individually Transferable Quotas (ITQs) and several input control measures since 1998. In this study, nine years of rock lobster fishing business data were used to categorise the catch and quota ownership traits and examine the response to the introduction of ITQ management. More specifically the study investigates how profit drivers moderated industry structure change. Owners who are not active fishers (investors) have steadily grown in number with a commensurate expansion of the lease quota market. A cap on the maximum allowed number of quota units per legal entity of 200 units (around 2{\%} of the total) was implemented at the start of ITQ management and this has proven effective in the maintenance of diverse ownership with little processor control. Active fishers who lease in quota (lease dependent fishers) took a large proportion of the total catch in 2007. An economic pressure to expand lease operations was identified, which accrued through better utilisation of capital. The pressure to increase in size through leasing in quota exists for businesses with small holdings. In contrast, as ownership of quota increased to approximately 30 units, the marginal profitability of fishers increased through the opposite process, that is, reducing fishing activity and supplementing income by leasing out quota. Income supplementing appears to be a transitional state, and in time these quota owners will move to the more stable state of “investor”. Thus the fishery is trending towards a smaller number of highly active lease fishers with units supplied by a broad group of investors. Lease fishers need to move into the large-scale category catching at least 75 units to achieve a normal economic profit and remain viable in the long run. However, they face barriers to entry to this large catch category through high upfront capital investment costs. Other potential issues for management that arise are that their higher financial stress increases compliance risk and their lack of investment in quota assets reduces incentive for stewardship of the resource.},

abstract = {A B S T R A C T Based on qualitative data analysis, this paper makes three contributions: (1) following recent privatization policies, social inequality emerged across New England's two most prominent fisheries—the scallop and groundfish fisheries. Given that inequality is not solely a financial phenomenon but also social, engrained in daily practices, the decline in bonding capital serves as an important indicator of this growing disparity between vessel owners and active crewmembers. (2) While the resulting class formation is characterized by differences in labor precarity in the scallop fishery, it is characterized by differences in labor inactivity in the groundfish fishery. Labor precarity refers to the disproportionate risk and vulnerability experienced by active scallop boat crew-members as compared to vessel owners. Meanwhile labor inactivity describes both vessel owners' ability to earn money without fishing and fishermen's difficulty in finding employment, creating a sharp social divide between those who work and those who do not. The contraction of the active labor pool in the groundfish fishery co-incides with stronger ties of kinship, which serve as a survival tactic under times of stress. (3) Although there is a wealth of literature on the privatization of the world's oceans and inequality, few studies have investigated the textured experience of class formation, which this analysis seeks to remediate.},

abstract = {Abstract: State-space models are commonly used to incorporate process and observation errors in analysis of fisheries time series. A gap in analysis methods has been the lack of classical likelihood methods for nonlinear state-space models. We evaluate a method that uses weighted kernel density estimates of Bayesian posterior samples to estimate likelihoods (Monte Carlo Kernel Likelihoods, MCKL). Classical likelihoods require integration over the state-space, and we compare MCKL to the widely used errors-in-variables (EV) method, which estimates states jointly with parameters by maximizing a nonintegrated likelihood. For a simulated, linear, autoregressive model and a Schaefer model fit to cape hake (Merluccius capensis × M. paradoxus) data, classical likelihoods outperform EV likelihoods, which give asymptotically biased parameter estimates and inaccurate confidence regions. Our results on the importance of integrated state-space likelihoods also support the value of Bayesian analysis with Monte Carlo posterior integration. Both approaches provide valuable insights and can be used complementarily. Previously, Bayesian analysis was the only option for incorporating process and observation errors with complex nonlinear models. The MCKL method provides a classical approach for such models, so that choice of analysis approach need not depend on model complexity.},

However, whether social norms can increase liking and taste perception of food products has not been studied so far. Across two studies, we investigated the impact of on-pack social norm messages (no norm, descriptive or injunctive) and focus (taste or health) on choice and liking of salt-reduced products. In Study I, we investigated the effects of on-pack social norm messages on choice of salt-reduced products in an online shelf purchase test (n=491). In Study II, we investigated the effects of on-pack social norm messages on liking and salt taste perception of salt-reduced products after tasting (n=194). Results of Study I showed that focus rather than social norms impacted product choice: participants chose soups with a health focused message significantly more than soups with a taste focused message, regardless of social norm condition. Results of Study II showed that, just before tasting, participants expected the soups with the descriptive norm messages to be saltier but not better liked than the other soups. When actually tasting the soups, the descriptive norm messages did not influence salt taste perception nor liking, i.e. all soups were similarly perceived in saltiness and liking. No effects were found of injunctive norms on expectations, perceptions and liking. Implications with regard to theory and practice are discussed.},

In particular, Friedman argued that monetary policy could not permanently influence the levels of real output, unemployment, or real rates of return on securities. However, Friedman did assert that a monetary authority could exert substantial control over the inflation rate, especially in the long run. The purpose of this paper* is to argue that, even in an economy that satisfies monetarist assumptions, if monetary policy is interpreted as open market operations, then Friedman's list of the things that monetary policy cannot permanently control may have to be expanded to include inflation. In the context of this paper, an economy that satisfies monetarist assumptions (or, a monetarist economy) has two characteristics: the monetary base is closely connect- ed to the price level, and the monetary authority can raise seignorage, by which we mean revenue from money creation. We will show that, under certain circumstances, the monetary authority's control over inflation in a monetarist economy is very limited even though the monetary base and the price level remain closely connected. In particular, we will demonstrate that this is true when monetary and fiscal policies are coordinated in a certain way and the public's demand for interest-bearing government debt has a certain form.},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to show that Wroe Alderson's contributions to marketing
thought earn him recognition as the “Father of Modern Marketing.”
Design/methodology/approach – An extensive review of writings by and about Alderson,
a thorough examination of the history of marketing thought literature, and the personal remembrances
of one of the authors, are drawn upon to organize Alderson's numerous contributions to the marketing
literature into a small number of categories. Such an organization is expected to provide a big picture
overview of Alderson's significant impact on marketing thought.
Findings – Alderson's contributions to the marketing discipline can be organized into three broad
categories, which collectively produced a tectonic shift in academic thinking about marketing: from
distribution (macro) to marketing management (micro); from economics to the behavioral sciences; and
from description and classification to explanation and theory building. These epic transformations
have become so embedded in the marketing literature that they are now taken for granted, but they are
so significant they represent a paradigm shift in marketing thought. Because of this legacy, the authors
argue Wroe Alderson has earned the honorific title: “Father of Modern Marketing.”
Practical implications – This work provides an historical context to understand the origins of
modern marketing thought by recognizing the most dynamic marketing thinker of the last
half-century.
Originality/value – This paper organizes the many and varied contributions of Wroe Alderson into
broad categories in a context that is useful for researchers studying the history of marketing thought.
The organization of Alderson's contributions also provides an historical foundation for scholars
working on a general theory of marketing.},

abstract = {The Bayesian approach to stock assessment determines the probabilities of alternative hypotheses using information for the stock in question and from inferences for other stocks/species. These probabilities are essential if the consequences of alternative management actions are to be evaluated through a decision analysis. Using the Bayesian approach to stock assessment and decision analysis it becomes possible to admit the full range of uncertainty and use the collective historical experience of fisheries science when estimating the consequences of proposed management actions. Recent advances in computing algorithms and power have allowed methods based on the Bayesian approach to be used even for fairly complex stock assessment models and to be within the reach of most stock assessment scientists. However, to avoid coming to ill-founded conclusions, care must be taken when selecting prior distributions. In particular, selection of priors designed to be noninformative with respect to quantities of interest to management is problematic.

abstract = {The Chesapeake Bay is the largest estuary in the United States and the third largest in the world. The surrounding Watershed encompasses 64,000 square miles, and is home to about 18 million people. There have been numerous studies measuring the value of different components of the Chesapeake Bay but no study or set of studies provides a comprehensive estimate of the values associated with the improvements likely to result from recently implemented pollution limits. To fill this gap we developed a stated preference (SP) survey that uses a discrete choice experiment response format to examine households' willingness to pay (WTP) for water quality improvements in the Chesapeake Bay. During extensive focus group testing, care was taken to identify the environmental attributes that are most important to both users and non-users and to quantitatively describe these attributes using understandable and tangible metrics. The survey was mailed to a stratified random sample of households across 17 states in the eastern U.S. and the District of Columbia. This paper reports the results of the empirical analysis, including marginal WTP estimates for each environmental attribute and total WTP for the expected outcome of the pollution reduction program. A comparison of WTP across households suggests that a substantial portion of the benefits can be attributed to nonusers. Results also show that benefits from improving water quality in freshwater lakes in the Watershed are an important ancillary benefit likely to result from reducing pollution in the Bay.},

SDM is a value-focused thinking approach that places paramount importance on first establishing clear management objectives that reflect core values of stakeholders. To be useful for management, objectives must be transparently stated in unambiguous and measurable terms. We used these concepts to develop consensus objectives for the multiple stakeholders of horseshoe crab harvest in Delaware Bay. Participating stakeholders first agreed on a qualitative statement of fundamental objectives, and then worked to convert those objectives to specific and measurable quantities, so that management decisions could be assessed. We used a constraint-based approach where the conservation objectives for Red Knots, a species of migratory shorebird that relies on horseshoe crab eggs as a food resource during migration, constrained the utility of crab harvest. Developing utility functions to effectively reflect the management objectives allowed us to incorporate stakeholder risk aversion even though different stakeholder groups were averse to different or competing risks. While measurable objectives and quantitative utility functions seem scientific, developing these objectives was fundamentally driven by the values of the participating stakeholders.},

A scale of numbers from 1 to 9 is introduced together with a discussion of how it compares with other scales. To illustrate the theory, it is then applied to some examples for which the answer is known, offering the opportunity for validating the approach. The discussion is then extended to multiple criterion decision making by formally introducing the notion of a hierarchy, investigating some properties of hierarchies, and applying the eigenvalue approach to scaling complex problems structured hierarchically to obtain a unidimensional composite vector for scaling the elements falling in any single level of the hierarchy. A brief discussion is also included regarding how the hierarchy serves as a useful tool for decomposing a large-scale problem, in order to make measurement possible despite the now-classical observation that the mind is limited to 7 ± 2 factors for simultaneous comparison. {\textcopyright}1977.},

The struggle between different actors over these objectives has generated distinct forms of neoliberalism in different regions and fishing fleets. In the lobster fishery, the right to fish has been concentrated since limited-entry licensing policy was introduced in the 1980s. This paper examines actors and events at two scales, including Lobster Fishing Area (LFA) 34 Advisory Committee meetings involving fishermen, representatives of Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO), and other stakeholders, and broader scale strategies of the Canadian Independent Fish Harvesters Federation (CIFHF). A Foucauldian perspective aids in understanding how fisheries governance is the product of struggles between the power and agency of individual fishermen, fishing organizations, processing companies, the DFO, the Minister of Fisheries and the courts. While many theorists view fisheries through the lens of the “tragedy of the commons”, alternative tragedies are developing in Atlantic Canadian fisheries. These include rising levels of debt, reduced earnings, vulnerability to financial volatility, loss of fishing rights within communities, and too much processor control.},

For this study, data were collected from 67 foodcrop farmers who were randomly selected among foodcrop farmers in the study area. The stochastic frontier production function methodology was used to empirically determine the level of technical efficiency of the farmers as well as the factors that influence the efficiency. Given the specifications of a translog stochastic frontier production function, in which the technical inefficiency effects are specified to be functions of several explanatory variables, the inefficiency effects of the smallholder farmers were significant. The estimated technical efficiencies of the sample farmers varied widely, ranging from 19{\%} to 95{\%}, with a mean value of 82{\%}, indicating that the farmers are 82{\%} efficient in the use of their production inputs. Age of farmer, farming experience, level of education, size of farm holdings as well as the ratio of hired labor to total labor use, were factors that significantly influenced the level of technical efficiency. The results show that the technical inefficiency of farmers increases with age, farm size and the ratio of hired labor to total labor, while the level of technical inefficiency tends to decline with years of experience and level of education. The results indicate an increasing returns-to-scale parameter which is significantly different from unity.},

abstract = {Fishing fleets are subject to numerous factors that affect economic performance, making identification and attribution of such impacts difficult. This paper separately identifies the effects of changing input and output prices, fishery management, and quota allocations on total factor productivity using a Lowe Index. Indices account for technical change and decompose productivity estimates into its technical, environmental, and scale-mix components. This results in measures that reflect shifts in the production frontier, and movements by vessels toward and around the frontier, to capture economies of scale and mix after a policy shift to a catch share program that includes fishing cooperatives and a limited access fishery. The difference between cooperative and limited access vessels is exploited to compare the changes in economic performance between the groups after the introduction of the shift to catch shares and cooperative management, which allowed the vessels to improve the timing and coordination across multi-species fisheries and to decrease incidental catch of quota-limited bycatch species that had closed the target fisheries prematurely in the past. Results indicate that total factor productivity increased significantly after the move to a catch share program, largely due to increases in technical change that shifted out the production frontier of the fishery.},

However, the role of fisheries in national and regional economies is neither well documented nor understood. National accounts do not fully reflect the significant part played by the fisheries as they do not take into consideration the various ways economic activity in the fisheries sector affects other branches of the economy.

Using data collected during 2010 and 2011 and cluster analysis techniques, this paper seeks to establish the economic importance of the fishing industry in Iceland.

Although many of the same fishermen who are causing these declines stand to suffer the most from them, they continue to overfish. Why is this happening? What can be done to solve the problem.The authors of Fish, Markets, and Fishermen argue that the reasons are primarily economic, and that overfishing is an inevitable consequence of the current sets of incentives facing ocean fishermen. This volume illuminates these incentives as they operate both in the aggregate and at the level of day-to-day decision-making by vessel skippers. The authors provide a primer on fish population biology and the economics of fisheries under various access regimes, and use that information in analyzing policies for managing fisheries. The book: provides a concise statistical overview of the world's fisheries documents the decline of fisheries worldwide gives the reader a clear understanding of the economics and population biology of fish examines the management issues associated with regulating fisheries offers case studies of fisheries under different management regimes examines and compares the consequences of various regimes and considers the implications for policy makingThe decline of the world's ocean fisheries is of enormous worldwide significance, from both economic and environmental perspectives. This book clearly explains for the nonspecialist the complicated problem of overfishing.

The software tool was developed in a consultative process with key experts and follows the hierarchical tree approach recommended in the FAO guidelines for responsible fisheries. Input variables are based both on quantitative data and expert opinion. We evaluated the model in terms of robustness to input changes, influence of system structure, and appropriateness of input scales for parameters based on expert opinion. Results show that the model is robust and conservative. The strength of the approach lies in the ability to include variables that are difficult to measure. It provides a means of rendering value judgements explicit and transparent. The tool synthesises a large amount of information and aims at improving understanding rather than achieving precision. The system has the potential to have wide application in the context of EAF.},

The theoretical model is based on the Schaefer (1954) model on dynamics of population and the Fox (1970) exponential surplus model for optimisation. The main elements of this model are (i) a biomass growth function, (ii) a harvest function and (iii) a fisheries profit function. The current biomass, fishing effort, profits and economic rents were determined against those of an optimal sustainable fishery at an equilibrium level. The fishery inefficiency was determined and an optimal recovery path devised. An efficient management system was proposed to induce efficiency in the fishery and give incentives to fishers in the implementation of a fishery recovery strategy and for sustainable fishery management.},

Four types of model are identified: Descriptive multispecies, dynamic multispecies, aggregate system, and dynamic system models. The strengths and weaknesses of multispecies models and their ability to evaluate the causal mechanisms underlying shifts in production are examined. This comparison provides a basis for assessing the benefits of each modelling approach as a tool for evaluating impacts of fishing in marine ecosystems. Benefits of multispecies models include: improved estimates of natural mortality and recruitment; better understanding of spawner-recruit relationships and of variability in growth rates; alternative views on biological reference points; and a framework for evaluating ecosystem properties. Populations are regulated by competition (food limitation), predation, and environmental variability. Each factor may influence different life-history stages, locally or regionally. However, most multispecies models address only a subset of these factors, often aggregated over functionally different species or age groups. Models that incorporate the important interactions at specific stages and scales will be necessary if they are to continue to supplement the information provided by single-species models.

This is mainly due to DEA and FDH representing deterministic approaches that are highly sensitive to outliers and measurement errors. However, recently, so-called partial frontier approaches namely order-m and order-{\$}\alpha{\$} have been developed. They generalize FDH by allowing for super-efficient observations to be located beyond the estimated production-possibility frontier. Although these methods are purely non- parametric too, sensitivity to outliers is substantially reduced by partial frontier approaches enveloping just a sub-sample of observations. We introduce the new Stata commands orderm and orderalpha that implement order-m, order-{\$}\alpha{\$}, and FDH efficiency analysis in Stata. The commands allow for several options, such as statistical inference based on sub-sampling bootstrap.},

This paper explores three modes of marine governance in Thailand and discusses the challenges each faces when delivering conservation and sustainable development objectives. Focusing on Marine Protected Areas (MPA), the dominant management approaches to biodiversity conservation, centralised, decentralised and shared governance, are scrutinised through a review of the literature and 24 key informant interviews with leading Thai academics, national and regional government officers and NGOs. We find both the centralised, state-managed MPA system and the decentralised, community-based MPA system to have severe limitations, for different reasons, in protecting biodiversity, whereas shared governance, despite being less common, is the best intermediate mode. Shared governance is the most viable option available in Thailand for working towards key CBD targets because: (1) local participation can legitimise much of the relationship with the centralised system and can help embed a decentralised system in natural resources management; (2) the centralised system will still remain in ultimate control, which, whilst not favoured by those who want decentralisation, will satisfy powerful elites, and offer more opportunity to empower local people to take responsibility for conservation targets; and (3) the capacity of both local and national stakeholders can be built to deal with the complexity of the marine environment.},

abstract = {The classical tools in spatial statistics are stationary models, like the Mat$\backslash$'ern field. However, in some applications there are boundaries, holes, or physical barriers in the study area, e.g. a coastline, and stationary models will inappropriately smooth over these features, requiring the use of a non-stationary model. We propose a new model, the Barrier model, which is different from the established methods as it is not based on the shortest distance around the physical barrier, nor on boundary conditions. The Barrier model is based on viewing the Mat$\backslash$'ern correlation, not as a correlation function on the shortest distance between two points, but as a collection of paths through a Simultaneous Autoregressive (SAR) model. We then manipulate these local dependencies to cut off paths that are crossing the physical barriers. To make the new SAR well behaved, we formulate it as a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE) that can be discretised to represent the Gaussian field, with a sparse precision matrix that is automatically positive definite. The main advantage with the Barrier model is that the computational cost is the same as for the stationary model. The model is easy to use, and can deal with both sparse data and very complex barriers, as shown in an application in the Finnish Archipelago Sea. Additionally, the Barrier model is better at reconstructing the modified Horseshoe test function than the standard models used in R-INLA.},

For many coastal fisheries in Japan, maintaining a management scheme in which stakeholders play an active role in determining fisheries measures seems more relevant if their priority is to maintain the stability of coastal communities and equity of stakeholders. Intensive dialog among stakeholders would be necessary to identify shared objectives of their fishery operations and to make decisions to establish specific steps toward the goal of increasing economic efficiency, environmental sustainability, or stability of communities and equity of stakeholders.},

abstract = {This paper combines the static effect of ownership and the dynamic effect of privatization on bank performance in China over 1995-2010, reporting a significantly higher performance by private intermediaries - joint stock commercial banks and city commercial banks - relative to state-owned commercial banks. However, publicly traded banks, subject to multiple monitoring and vetting in capital markets, perform better regardless of ownership status. The privatization of banks has improved performance with respect to revenue inflow and efficiency gains in the short- or long-run (initial public offerings). The positive long-run effect is more relevant and significant for banking institutions with minority foreign ownership. Moreover, this paper innovatively estimates interest income efficiency and non-interest income efficiency at the same time. The results suggest that Chinese banks are much more efficient in generating interest income than raising non-interest revenue, although the latter aspect has improved significantly during the sample period. {\textcopyright}2013 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {This paper reports on the results of an investigation of management costs in the fisheries of Iceland. Newfoundland and Norway and discusses them in a more general framework. Management costs are defined as costs necessary to overcome the problems associated with common property. The question of whether management costs should be paid by industry is discussed, as is the likely effect of user pay on the efficiency with which management is provided. Since management has public goods characteristics, it is likely that there is an unavoidable role for government in providing these services. The question of who pays for it is separate, and recovering costs from industry has both efficiency and optimal taxation aspects. A greater involvement in management by industry further raises the question of compatibility between the industry's interests and the public interest. Measured as percent of gross value of fish landings the management costs are by far highest in Newfoundland (15-25{\%}), lowest in Iceland (about 3{\%}), with Norway in the middle (about 10{\%}). Management costs thus appear to be substantial and quite variable. This gives rise to three conclusions. First, when calculating optimal harvesting and investment paths one must take the management costs of implementing these paths explicitly into account. Second, what is the economic efficiency of management? Could the same level of benefits be produced at lower costs? Third, can fisheries management expenditures of the magnitude discussed be justified in the sense that the benefits exceed the costs? (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The fishing industry in Abu-Dhabi, United Arab Emirates (UAE), plays an important role in diversifying food sources in order to enhance national food security. The fishing industry is facing an increasing risk that may impact the sustainability (i.e., quantity and quality) of the fish caught and consumed in the UAE. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to analyze common Abu-Dhabi fishing management alternatives using various stochastic dominance techniques (i.e., first/second degree stochastic dominance, stochastic dominance with respect to a function and stochastic efficiency with respect to a function) to assess the risk facing UAE fishermen. The techniques represent a risk assessment continuum, which can provide a ranking of management alternatives to improve decision making outcomes and help maintain long-term UAE fishing sustainability. Data for the stochastic dominance analyses were obtained from a cross-sectional survey conducted through face-to-face interviews of Abu Dhabi, UAE, fishermen. Analysis of fishing methods, trap sizes and trap numbers using stochastic efficiency with respect to a function (SERF) showed that fishermen efficient practices were not the same for risk-neutral fishermen compared to risk averse fishermen. Overall, the stochastic dominance results illustrated the importance of considering both attitude towards risk and economic inefficiencies in managing UAE fishery practices and designing successful fishery policies, as well as improving decision-making at the fishermen level.},

The number of possible fisheries management systems is very large, as demonstrated in the paper. It is obviously not practical to compare the empirical outcomes of all these systems. It is therefore potentially very useful to develop a reasonably simple measure to assess the economic efficiency of the various fisheries management systems that may be proposed. Luckily, it turns out that by appealing to the basic theory of property rights and economic efficiency such measures are available. In the paper, two such measures are proposed; a simple graphical measure based on radar diagrams and a more flexible numerical measure, referred to as the Q-measure. The properties of these measures are discussed in the paper and their use illustrated by means of examples.},

This article argues that the most likely future development is that of a state in free association with Denmark.

abstract = {This paper considers four alternative policies for controlling harvest within a fishery: (1) individual limits without a permit market, (2) individual limits with a permit market, (3) a collective limit with individual decisions, and (4) a collective limit with collective decisions. We focus on three issues: risk pooling, moral hazard, and the role of permit trading. We find that, as long as the penalty rates are set appropriately, all four policies can yield the first best. Thus, with a welfare-maximizing regulator who sets policy parameters optimally, there is no efficiency basis for preferring one over the other. In particular, allowing permit trading and risk pooling does not increase efficiency. However, the four policies differ in terms of their impact on the expected profit of harvesters. Thus, there is a distributional basis for distinguishing among the four policies. We find that in the absence of permit trading and moral hazard, the collective limit with collective decisions yields higher expected profits than the individual limits. However, the moral hazard problem that arises under the collective limit with individual decisions makes harvesters worse off in terms of distributional impact. Finally, although the permit market provides an opportunity for risk spreading for harvesters, the potential moral hazard problem leads to a detrimental distributional impact on harvesters under permit trading. Thus, contrary to standard results, here allowing permits to be traded has no efficiency impact and makes harvesters worse off.},

abstract = {During the past three decades considerable changes have taken place within the Icelandic pelagic industry which, previously considered rather fragmented, is now a highly concentrated vertically integrated industry due to considerable consolidations of quotas. During this period, changes in the ecosystem around Iceland have also brought valuable pelagic species such as Atlanto-Scandian herring and Atlantic mackerel to the EEZ, while other species such as capelin have declined. Part of the concentration within the pelagic sector can be attributed to changes in the ITQ management system and company adjustments to laws and regulations. Another aspect can be attributed to the entrance of valuable species into the Icelandic EEZ and decreasing quotas of fishmeal oriented species. Finally technology changes have increased production efficiency in processing and fisheries. All this has altered the Icelandic pelagic industry in three ways: Firstly, processing for human consumption has increased with additional species and advances in processing technology. Secondly, raw material for the fishmeal industry has declined parallel with lower capelin quotas. Thirdly, a number of processing utilities and vessels have been scrapped, affecting employment in many fishing villages.},

abstract = {A participatory Bayesian approach was used to investigate how the views of stakeholders could be utilized to develop models to help understand the Central Baltic herring fishery. In task one, we applied the Bayesian belief network methodology to elicit the causal assumptions of six stakeholders on factors that influence natural mortality, growth, and egg survival of the herring stock in probabilistic terms. We also integrated the expressed views into a meta-model using the Bayesian model averaging (BMA) method. In task two, we used influence diagrams to study qualitatively how the stakeholders frame the management problem of the herring fishery and elucidate what kind of causalities the different views involve. The paper combines these two tasks to assess the suitability of the methodological choices to participatory modeling in terms of both a modeling tool and participation mode. The paper also assesses the potential of the study to contribute to the development of participatory modeling practices. It is concluded that the subjective perspective to knowledge, that is fundamental in Bayesian theory, suits participatory modeling better than a positivist paradigm that seeks the objective truth. The methodology provides a flexible tool that can be adapted to different kinds of needs and challenges of participatory modeling. The ability of the approach to deal with small data sets makes it cost-effective in participatory contexts. However, the BMA methodology used in modeling the biological uncertainties is so complex that it needs further development before it can be introduced to wider use in participatory contexts.},

abstract = {Twelve species of cetaceans are regarded as regular inhabitants in Icelandic and adja- cent waters. Based on available estimates of the total food consumption of the cetaceans in the area, this paper explores potential interactions between three baleen whale species off Iceland and the relevant fish resources that constitute a part of their diet prey. The three species of whales are fin whale (Balaenoptera physalus), the largest cetacean con- sumer in this area, feeding mainly on krill (Meganyctiphanes norvegica) but also preying on some fish species like capelin (Mallotus villosus); minke whale (Balaenoptera acutorostrata), taking krill as well as a variety of fish, including capelin and gadoids (e.g. cod, Gadus morhua); and humpback whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) assumed to be feeding mainly on capelin. The study is based on a variety of assumptions regarding stock sizes, food prefer- ence, potential rates of increase and harvesting strategies. A single-species model devel- oped for investigating the effects of different utilization policies of the Icelandic cod stock is combined with a crude multispecies model and these are used to study the poten- tial impacts on capelin and cod stocks by various developments of the whale stocks under consideration. A Pella-Tomlinson like model is used to describe the whale stocks. The population and fisheries dynamics for shrimp (Pandalus borealis) and capelin (both im- portant food items for cod) are described using simple models. Thus, only aggregates such as total, recruiting or adult numbers or biomass are considered as opposed to the fully age-class based cod model. The results indicate that both minke and humpback whales may have significant di- rect impact on the status of the capelin stock. The effects of fin whale predation on the capelin stock seems less significant unless such consumption occurs outside the sampled area, which is quite possible. The impact of the three baleen whale species on the devel- opment of the cod stock is uncertain, but may be considerable.},

abstract = {a b s t r a c t With the financial support of several large foundations and the federal government, cre-ating small schools has become a prominent high school reform strategy in many large American cities. While some research supports this strategy, little research assesses the relative costs of these smaller schools. We use data on over 200 New York City high schools, from 1996 through 2003, to estimate school cost functions relating per pupil expenditures to school size, controlling for school output and quality, student characteristics, and school organization. We find that the structure of costs differs across schools depending upon mission—comprehensive or themed. At their current levels of outputs, themed schools minimize per pupil costs at smaller enrollments than comprehensive schools, but these optimally sized themed schools also cost more per pupil than optimally sized comprehen-sive schools. We also find that both themed and comprehensive high schools at actual sizes are smaller than their optimal sizes.},

abstract = {The implementation of the European Union (EU) Marine Strategy Framework Directive (MSFD) requires EU Member States to draft a program of measures to achieve Good Environmental Status (GES). Central argument of this paper, based on an analysis of the unique, holistic character of the MSFD, is that social and political factors are having a major influence on this MSFD implementation process. More specifically, four potential impediments have been identified that are curtailing the drive towards the effective implementation of the scheme advanced by the Directive. First, scientific uncertainty about aggregated ecological pressure and drivers in relation to the different sectors clouds the definition of national programmes of measures and this in turn may lead to implementation-drift in achieving GES. Second, the scale of the ecosystem is different from the political and socio-economic scales of individual, sectoral decision-making and activities. Third, policy coordination is required on several levels, i.e. at the EU level, within the Regional Sea Conventions, at national level and between these three levels. Finally, the coming together of both stakeholder involvement organized for the MSFD and those of existing, sectoral policy domains makes fair and efficient stakeholder involvement challenging. This paper concludes that more attention should be rendered to establishing appropriate coordination and communication structures, which facilitate greater engagement with the different Directorates-General in the European Commission, the European Council and the Parliament, the Member States, sectoral decision making institutions as well as stakeholder interest groups. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

Findings – For Javanese ethnic group in Indonesia, “save money” and “health benefits” are identified views that motivate consumers purchasing their local foods. Research limitations/implications – Although investigating the largest ethnic groups in Indonesia, the results of this study cannot be generalized to all Indonesian consumers and a larger sample needs to be studied to generalize the results to the wider population of Indonesia. Practical implications – It is better for the Government to promote local food policies that is based on identified motivations of consumers. “Save money” and “health benefits” themes can be used as the central messages for the development of advertising strategies.

This model was also spatially-and temporally-structured to account for differences in costs of fishing and prices as well as differences in abundance and productivity among regions within the fishery. The current total allowable commercial catch (TACC) was found to be higher than the level that would maximise economic yield, and this left the industry vulnerable to temporal changes in productivity. Alternative pathways to lower TACCs were explored, but these had less effect on economic yield than the final TACC. The TACC did not move towards MEY through normal decision-making based on biological stock assessments despite the fishery operating under individual transferable quota (ITQ) management for over a decade. This is because industry and government have struggled to accept that economic yield and asset values could increase with lower catches. Bioeconomic analysis assisted in debate on decreasing the TACC, suggesting formal economic analysis is required for effective ITQ management.},

An objective of the paper is to preserve the concept of such a policy rule in a policy environment where it is practically impossible to follow mechanically any particular algebraic formula that describes the policy rule. The discussion centers around a hypothetical but representative policy rule much like that advocated in recent research. This rule closely approximates Federal Reserve policy during the past several years. Two case studies—German unification and the 1990 oil-price shock—that had a bearing on the operation of monetary policy in recent years are used to illustrate how such a policy rule might work in practice.},

We will use the introduction of individual tradable quotas in the management of the Dutch North Sea beam trawl fisheries as a case for exploring the effect of the introduction of such an instrument. The effect will be assessed in terms of reduction of fishing capacity in the Dutch beam trawl fleet and its economic and social impact. These Dutch experiences will be translated to the current debate on the reform of the EU Common Fisheries Policy. Especially, we will focus on the issues of "relative stability", the concentration of rights, and the effects on the small-scale fisheries sector. Some of the negative effects associated with individual tradable rights can be addressed through design.

abstract = {Managing fisheries resources to maintain healthy ecosystems is one of the main goals of the ecosystem approach to fisheries (EAF). While a number of international treaties call for the implementation of EAF, there are still gaps in the underlying methodology. One aspect that has received substantial scientific attention recently is fisheries-induced evolution (FIE). Increasing evidence indicates that intensive fishing has the potential to exert strong directional selection on life-history traits, behaviour, physiology, and morphology of exploited fish. Of particular concern is that reversing evolutionary responses to fishing can be much more difficult than reversing demographic or phenotypically plastic responses. Furthermore, like climate change, multiple agents cause FIE, with effects accumulating over time. Consequently, FIE may alter the utility derived from fish stocks, which in turn can modify the monetary value living aquatic resources provide to society. Quantifying and predicting the evolutionary effects of fishing is therefore important for both ecological and economic reasons. An important reason this is not happening is the lack of an appropriate assessment framework. We therefore describe the evolutionary impact assessment (EvoIA) as a structured approach for assessing the evolutionary consequences of fishing and evaluating the predicted evolutionary outcomes of alternative management options. EvoIA can contribute to EAF by clarifying how evolution may alter stock properties and ecological relations, support the precautionary approach to fisheries management by addressing a previously overlooked source of uncertainty and risk, and thus contribute to sustainable fisheries.},

abstract = {When more than one time series of abundance indices is used in an assessment model such as a surplus production model or VPA, it is necessary to determine the relative weights of the various series and observations in the series. Each weight is typically represented by the inverse of a parameter for the variance of the deviation between each model predicted and time series observation. The weights may be either fixed beforehand or estimated. This assigning of weights has long been a contentious issue in many stock assessments because there is no universally accepted protocol and the resulting policy recommendations can depend strongly on the weighting method applied. This paper reviews and reformulates the key methodological considerations in the assigning of weights, summarizes the various pros and cons of some alternative weighting methods and attempts to identify alternatives that most adequately address the various considerations. This paper evaluates the relative merits and potential effects on stock assessment results of applying nine alternative methods to weight different abundance series. For simplicity, the numerical evaluation will be undertaken by fitting a simple surplus production model to the catch rate data used in the 1998 assessment of western Atlantic bluefin tuna (Thunnus thynnus). Because other stock assessment methods used by ICCAT, such as ADAPT VPA, rely heavily on the tuning of modeled trends in abundance to the available abundance series data and their relative weightings, it should be possible to readily generalize the results to these other methods.},

abstract = {Discarding of target species can be substantial in some fisheries. For fisheries managed using Total Allowable Catches, such as Australia's Southern and Eastern Scalefish and Shark Fishery (SESSF), discarding of target species can occur for reasons related to the size of the fish caught, markets, and the amount of quota held by individual quota holders. This paper illustrates how the assessments for two of the species in the SESSF, blue grenadier, Macruronus novaezelandiae, and the western stock of blue warehou, Seriolella brama, are conducted to take account of discards. Discards of blue grenadier are predominantly small fish so the assessment distinguishes between retained and discarded fish, and includes likelihood components related to the weight of the discards and the age-structure of the discards. In contrast, discards of blue warehou are due primarily to quota-related issues, so the assessment adds the discards to the catches and the catch-rate indices, and fits to total catches and catch-rates. Model outputs suggest that strong year-classes can be detected before they enter the fishery by including data on discards in assessments while ignoring such data when conducting assessments can lead to biased assessment outcomes. Several caveats related to the use of data on discards in stock assessments are outlined. Crown Copyright {\textcopyright} 2006.},

It is further speculated that angling in Scotland generates about €147 million in output and is responsible for €71 million of the income per annum, and that between 2450 and 2800 jobs depend - directly or indirectly - on angling. The Icelandic study estimates angler expenditure at €21.1-24.6 million, and the total output effect at €84.9-99.6 million. These are though overestimates, as they do not allow for any possible substitution effects.

abstract = {Marine governance in European seas is at a crossroad aiming towards implementation of eco-system based marine management (EBMM) through integration of different EU policies or directives to protect the environment, while at the same time expected to facilitate growth and employment in support of the blue economy. This article shows that the governance landscape at the regional sea level is very complex, fragmented and faced with several dilemmas. It examines the present governance structures in the four European seas (Baltic, Black, and Mediterranean Seas and North East Atlantic Ocean). It is argued that the implementation of EBMM at the regional sea level is characterized by a highly fragmented European governance system where there is lack of coordination between relevant DGs within the European Commission, between EU, International organisations, Regional Sea Conventions and the Member States and between sectoral governance arrangements that should provide sectoral management measures that support EBMM. The article develops suggestions for a nested governance system in which institutions, policies, laws and sectors are nested into a tiered, internally consistent and mutually re-enforcing planning and decision-making system. Developing institutional interaction and soft modes of governance between the EU, the Regional Sea Conventions, Member States and the governance arrangements of the different marine sectors will be crucial in evolving towards such a nested governance system for EBMM. Moreover, there is no one size fits all approach in implementing EBMM, which means that for each European Sea a context-dependent nested governance system should be developed.},

This paper focuses on the concept of ‘wellbeing' as a means to accomplish this integration, thereby unravelling and better assessing complex social and economic issues within the context of fisheries governance. We emphasize the relevance of the three key components of wellbeing – the material, relational and subjective dimensions, each of which is relevant to wellbeing at scales ranging from individual, household, community, fishery to human-ecological systems as a whole. We review nine major approaches influential in shaping current thinking and practice on wellbeing: the economics of happiness, poverty, capabilities, gender, human rights, sustainable livelihoods, vulnerability, social capital, and social wellbeing. The concept of identity is a thread that runs through the relational and subjective components of social wellbeing, as well as several other approaches and thus emerges as a critical element of small-scale fisheries that requires explicit recognition in governance analysis. A social wellbeing lens is applied to critically review a global body of literature discussing the social, economic and political dimensions of small-scale fishing communities, seeking to understand the relevance and value addition of applying wellbeing concepts in small-scale fisheries.},

For example, monetar incentives from principals may change how tasks are perceived by agents. If incen- tives are not large enough, this change in perception can lead to undesired effects on behavior. In other cases, incentives might have the desired effects in the short term, but they still weaken intrinsic motivations. Thus, once the incentives are removed, people may pursue the desired outcome less eagerly. To put it in concrete terms, an incentive for a child to read more might achieve that goal in the short term, but then be counterproductive as an incentive for students to enjoy reading and seek it out over their lifetimes.

These models must be able to predict the response of populations to anthropogenic change, while handling the major sources of uncertainty. We describe a simple ``building block'' approach to formulating discrete-time models. We show how to estimate the parameters of such models from time series of data, and how to quantify uncertainty in those estimates and in numbers of individuals of different types in populations, using computer-intensive Bayesian methods. We also discuss advantages and pitfalls of the approach, and give an example using the British grey seal population.},

abstract = {Fishing communities are subject to economic risk as the commercial fisheries they rely on are intrinsically volatile. The degree to which a community is exposed to economic risk depends on a community׳s ability to confront and/or alter its exposure to volatile fishery conditions through risk-reduction mechanisms. In this article, economic risk – as measured by community-level fishing gross revenues variability – is characterized across Alaskan fishing communities over the past two decades, and exploratory analyses are conducted to identify associations between community attributes and revenues variability. Results show that communities' fishing portfolio size and diversification are strongly related to fishing revenues variability. Communities with larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios experience lower fishing revenues variability. Portfolio size and diversification appear to be related to the number of local fisheries, indicating that communities' portfolios may be constrained to the set of local fisheries. Hotspots of relatively higher fishing revenues variability for communities in north and west Alaska were identified, mirroring the spatial distribution of fishery-specific ex-vessel revenues variability. This overall pattern suggests that a community׳s fishing portfolio – and hence its exposure to risk – may be “predetermined” by its location, thereby limiting the policy options available to promote economic stability through larger and/or more diverse fishing portfolios. For such communities, diversifying income across non-fishing sectors may be an important risk reduction strategy, provided any potential negative cross-sector externalities are addressed.},

abstract = {Social mobility presupposes geographical mobility in many rural areas. Migration decisions feature prominently in the lives of rural adolescents, and the viability of local communities often hangs in the balance. As in many other rural areas, the majority of adolescents in Icelandic fishing and farming communities expect to live somewhere else in the future. An analysis of national surveys in 1992 and 2003 reveal that perceptions of occupational opportunities are by far the strongest predictor of migration intentions, and they fully account for gender differences in this regard. Other significant predictors of wanting to stay include being raised in the community, parental support and parental control, and interest in working in the primary industry. Parental education is associated with increased migration intentions, but this effect operates through other factors. In the early 1990s, parental involvement in the primary industry and well-being in school predicted migration intentions, but these issues no longer appeared to be a factor in the early 2000s. Finally, adolescents who identify strongly with the local community and are more proud of their nationality are less likely to expect to migrate. These results are discussed in the context of changing social identities in an increasingly global culture. ?? 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Gadget is the Globally applicable Area-Disaggregated General Ecosystem Toolbox. Gadget is a powerful and flexible framework that has been developed to model complicated statistical marine ecosystems within a fisheries management and biological context, and can take many features of the ecosystem into account. Gadget allows the user to include a number of features of the ecosystem into the model: One or more species, each of which may be split into multiple components; multiple areas with migration between areas; predation between and within species; growth; maturation; reproduction and recruitment; multiple commercial and survey fleets taking catches from the populations. Gadget works by running an internal forward projection model based on many parameters describing the ecosystem, and then comparing the output from this model to observed measurements to get a likelihood score. The model ecosystem parameters can then be adjusted, and the model re-run, until an optimum is found, which corresponds to the model with the lowest likelihood score. This iterative, computationally intensive process is handled within Gadget, using a robust minimisation algorithm. Gadget has successfully been used to investigate the population dynamics of stock complexes in Icelandic waters, the Barents Sea, the North Sea, the Irish and Celtic Seas and the Sofala Bank fishery of Mozambique. This paper describes the structure and main components of an ecosystem model developed using the Gadget framework.},

abstract = {Traditional and emerging human activities are increasingly putting pressures on marine ecosystems and impacting their ability to sustain ecological and human communities. To evaluate the health status of marine ecosystems we need a science-based, integrated Ecosystem Approach, that incorporates knowledge of ecosystem function and services provided that can be used to track how management decisions change the health of marine ecosystems. Although many methods have been developed to assess the status of single components of the ecosystem, few exist for assessing multiple ecosystem components in a holistic way. To undertake such an integrative assessment, it is necessary to understand the response of marine systems to human pressures. Hence, innovative monitoring is needed to obtain data to determine the health of large marine areas, and in an holistic way. Here we review five existing methods that address both of these needs (monitoring and assessment): the Ecosystem Health Assessment Tool; a method for the Marine Strategy Framework Directive in the Bay of Biscay; the Ocean Health Index; the Marine Biodiversity Assessment Tool; and the Nested Environmental status Assessment Tool. We have highlighted their main characteristics and analyzing their commonalities and differences, in terms of: use of the Ecosystem Approach; inclusion of multiple components in the assessment; use of reference conditions; use of integrative assessments; use of a range of values to capture the status; weighting ecosystem components when integrating; determine the uncertainty; ensure spatial and temporal comparability; use of robust monitoring approaches; and address pressures and impacts. Ultimately, for any ecosystem assessment to be effective it needs to be: transparent and repeatable and, in order to inform marine management, the results should be easy to communicate to wide audiences, including scientists, managers and policymakers.},

abstract = {Iceland's nationwide privatized Individual Transferable Quota (ITQ) system is over thirty years old but remains a topic of public and political debate, particularly because of the continued effects on small-scale fisheries. A national survey of small-boat fishermen was distributed to: (1) identify major defining characteristics of participants in ITQ and non-ITQ fisheries, (2) document and examine differences in satisfaction with fisheries management, and (3) evaluate the existing options for newcomers to participate in small-boat fisheries. Survey results indicate that Icelandic small-boat fishermen are engaged in multiple management systems within a wide range of boat sizes. Those who held quota were more satisfied with the current ITQ system compared to those who did not hold quota; however, nearly all fishermen were still critical of fisheries management in Iceland and the two major non-ITQ options of lumpfish and coastal fishing were not perceived to offer significant opportunity for entry-level fishermen. Dissatisfaction stemmed from the lack of decision-making power, a distrust of scientific advice, and the perception that the ITQ system did not serve the purpose of protecting fisheries resources, but was rather oriented only toward economic goals. The dynamic nature of Icelandic small-boat fishing livelihoods and the pervasive negative attitudes thirty years after ITQ implementation demonstrate the need for culturally appropriate and equitable fisheries management schemes where success is measured in social as well as economic and biological terms.},

abstract = {Abstract Scholars of political ecology have long been interested in questions of access, equity, and power in environmental management. This paper explores these domains by examining lived experiences and daily realities in Iceland's fishing communities, 30 years after the implementation of a national privatized Individual Transferrable Quota (ITQ) fisheries management system. Drawing upon ethnographic data collected over 2 years in the rural coastal communities of Northwest Iceland, we address three questions; 1) How the ITQ system relates to other complex social and environmental factors facing coastal communities today. 2) How attempts to alleviate negative impacts of the ITQ system have led to new rifts in communities and 3) how the decision-making power of a few dominant interest groups in national politics leaves small-boat fishermen and rural communities at a disadvantage. In the words of our study participants, the Icelandic fisheries management scheme has created “little kings” in rural communities, where each little king acts in his own best interest, yet has no recourse to collective power and no platform to influence national politics. In this volatile political situation with cross-scale implications, it is difficult for fishermen, their families, and community members to imagine ways in which power over and access to the fisheries resource can be redistributed.

abstract = {In 1990, Iceland established a comprehensive fisheries management system based on individual transferable quotas (ITQs). Simultaneously, low-cost licence fees, which the fishing industry paid to the government, were introduced. As the ITQ system became more mature and the financial performance of the fisheries improved, there was increasing public demand for the sharing of its resource rent. A special resource committee was set up in 1998 to address these views and concluded that a new fishing fee should be established to cover the cost associated with managing and supervising the use of marine resources, as well as making certain that a visible share of the resource rent accrued to the public. Although the fishing fee has changed since its introduction in 2004, the basic principles behind the taxation remain the same. Five issues have made the introduction and implementation of the fishing fees difficult. The first regards the fee amount for different species. The second relates to the variance in profitability between harvesting companies. The third concerns measurement of revenue and profits from harvesting in vertically integrated firms. The fourth issue is related to how to deal with the debt burden that became quite large for many Icelandic harvesting firms after the financial crisis of 2008. Finally, obtaining reliable data has been a major challenge. This paper provides a background to the implementation of the Icelandic fishing fee, describes and investigates fishing fees issues and their address by the government. In 2014, the fee amounted to 52 million euros, 6.0{\%} of the catch value of Icelandic fishing vessels and around 1.2{\%} of the total revenue of the Icelandic Treasury.},

abstract = {The Icelandic fishing industry has had to deal with reduced total catch for the past three decades. It has adapted well to the reduction and the Icelandic ITQ system has made this easier. The industry has adapted by reducing employment, closing factories and scrapping boats. Specialization has as well increased and the focus is more toward high-value markets. The profitability of the Icelandic fishing industry has markedly increased. This is especially true for the processing aspect of the industry where profits have soared. One of the main reasons for this increase is the ITQ management system. The rise in profitability of the fishing component, however, is considerably less than that of the processing part. This is the result of higher oil prices and the introduction of the fishing fee, and its subsequent increase, which is now a considerable expense for the fishing component of the Icelandic fishing industry. The debt levels of the industry reached a peak in 2008 after a massive escalation which began in 2004 and was mainly caused by the Icelandic financial bubble, 2004-2008, although the ITQ system also played a role here. Since 2008 the financial health of the industry has improved enormously. Currently, the financial situation of the Icelandic fishing industry is, on the average, sound; this particularly applies to the largest and smallest firms.},

abstract = {A decision support concept (DSC) for sustainable management of the bottom trawl fleet was created in line with ecosystem-based management. It is based on principles that integrate ecological, social and techno-economic aspects of trawl fisheries in a multicriteria analysis approach. For the sake of greater transparency and improved stakeholder participation, elements of the proposed multicriteria models were discussed, generated and evaluated in collaboration with designated experts from four stakeholder groups: fishers, environmentally focused non-governmental organizations, fisheries scientists and government representatives. The proposed DSC management could facilitate management and assist decision makers in adequately using data and scientific advice to shape management strategies and related policies for the bottom trawl fleet. It may also assist in finding compromise solutions based on deliverables from the multicriteria analysis, while taking stakeholder requirements into account by using the multicriteria Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Preference Ranking Organization Method for Enrichment Evaluations (PROMETHEE) methods. The final decision is then based on a vast amount of knowledge and relevant information collected from different sources. The proposed DSC represents a novel approach to fishery fleet management and assists in systematizing management processes and instruments to make it operational at the strategic level. The method was applied to the Adriatic bottom trawl fishery, and the obtained results confirmed its managerial potential in the strategic decision-making process, aimed at improving conventional management, while considering the specific requirements of an ecosystem-based approach and ensuring stakeholder participation. {\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors.},

abstract = {Expansion and development of the fisheries was the driving force behind Iceland's economic transformation during the 20th century. Yet, the overriding importance of this sector fails to show up in national accounts – such as contribution to GDP and employment statistics –because they do not take into consideration the various ways economic activity in the maritime sectors affects other branches of the economy. In addition, the national accounts do not fully reflect the significant part played by the fisheries as the county's largest currency earning industry. This ignorance of the true contribution of the fisheries can lead policy makers to underestimate the effects shocks to the fisheries will have on the economy. In this paper, econometric methods are employed to estimate the overall contribution of the fishing industry to Icelandic GDP during the period 1963-1996. Using data on GDP, marine production, capital and labour, it is shown that in the long-run a 1{\%} change in the value of fishing industry production will lead to a 0.42{\%} increase in GDP growth. This is considerably higher than the 11{\%} the national accounts attribute to the fisheries.},

The survey has been carried out annually in March since 1985, covering the continental shelf waters around Iceland with 540-600 "semi-randomly" distributed tows. Biological data are collected for all fish species although sampling effort is basically related to economic importance of each species. At present Jength data are collected for all species, age data for 11 species and weight data for 3 species (cod, haddock and saithe). Stomach content is analyzed for cod. Standard environmental information (weather, sea conditions, etc.) including sea temperature is collected on every tow. Survey results have been used to monitor biological status (weight at age, maturity status), to predict recruitment and for asse ment caJibrations of cod and haddock. For se eral other demersal species indice for catchable stock and recruitment have been used to monitor status of the tocks and to support management advice. Analysis of trends in catchability of cod in the survey have given negative results, i.e. significant trends have not been observed. In general the survey has met its objectives quite weIl. However, an important critique relate to reduced catchability of mature cod in the main spawning area off the outhwestern coast and, therefore, less weight of spawning stock indices in a sessments calibrations. Another critique i the fact that saithe is not adequately covered in the urvey due to the pelagic behavior of the species. Two important demersal species, deep-sea redfish (Sebastes mentella) and Greenland halibut, are not covered in the survey due to their spatial di tributions outside the continental shelf area.},

abstract = {A decision-making framework combining multi-attribute utility theory and the analytic hierarchy process is proposed to assess the performances of alternative fisheries management policies. The framework is demonstrated by applying it to a Mediterranean demersal fishery (GSA 18, Southern Adriatic Sea), for which a set of management scenarios are evaluated against their ability to cope with environmental, economic and social objectives. To this aim, (1) a suite of biological and socioeconomic indicators is identified and organized into an appropriate hierarchy; (2) a set of utility functions is defined to express the level of satisfaction associated with different values of the indicators; and (3) a set of weights, representing the relative importance of each indicator to the overall utility, is derived through a pair-wise comparison of the indicators. The proposed approach provides a practical decision-support tool to identify the management scenarios that are most desirable from the society[U+05F3]s perspective, thus providing a good compromise between the environmental, economic and social aspects of the problem. The flexible structure of the framework allows the incorporation of different management criteria and utility functions to adapt it to different decision problems.},

abstract = {Fish stock productivity, and thereby sensitivity to harvesting, depends on physical (e.g. ocean climate) and biological (e.g. prey availability, competition and predation) processes in the ecosystem. The combined impacts of such ecosystem processes and fisheries have lead to stock collapses across the world. While traditional fisheries management focuses on harvest rates and stock biomass, incorporating the impacts of such ecosystem processes are one of the main pillars of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM). Although EAFM has been formally adopted widely since the 1990s, little is currently known to what extent ecosystem drivers of fish stock productivity are actually implemented in fisheries management. Based on worldwide review of more than 1200 marine fish stocks, we found that such ecosystem drivers were implemented in the tactical management of only 24 stocks. Most of these cases were in the North Atlantic and north-east Pacific, where the scientific support is strong. However, the diversity of ecosystem drivers implemented, and in the approaches taken, suggests that implementation is largely a bottom-up process driven by a few dedicated experts. Our results demonstrate that tactical fisheries management is still predominantly single-species oriented taking little account of ecosystem processes, implicitly ignoring that fish stock production is dependent on the physical and biological conditions of the ecosystem. Thus, while the ecosystem approach is highlighted in policy, key aspects of it tend yet not to be implemented in actual fisheries management.},

abstract = {Statistical models of marine ecosystems use a variety of data sources to estimate parameters using composite or weighted likelihood functions with associated weighting issues and questions on how to obtain variance estimates. Regardless of the method used to obtain point estimates, a method is required for variance estimation. A bootstrap technique is introduced for the evaluation of uncertainty in such models, taking into account inherent spatial and temporal correlations in the datasets, which are commonly transferred as assumptions from a likelihood estimation procedure into Hessian-based variance estimation procedures. The technique is demonstrated on a real dataset and the effects of the number of bootstrap samples on estimation bias and variance estimates are studied. Although the modelling framework and bootstrap method can be applied to multispecies and multiarea models, for clarity the case study described is of a single-species and single-area model.},

abstract = {The aim of this work is to measure the development of the concentration of quota holdings by harvesting companies and harbours in Iceland. For the period 1990–2014, the analysis traces the development of relative quota holdings of the biggest actors operating large vessels as well as firms that employ smaller boats that are only allowed to use hook-and-line. A more detailed data set is used for the period 2001–2014 which allows for a more thorough investigation of consolidation in both fleet segments using Herfindahl-Hirchman Indexes, Gini coefficients and Lorenz-curves. The biggest firms in the two fleet segments increased their share of quotas throughout the period but the quota market is though still quite competitive. The distribution of quotas between firms has become more unequal, and there is also clear evidence of increasing transfers between harbours, especially in the case of the quota shares of hook-and-line boats. However, the results also indicate that spatial concentration has been much less than consolidation at firm level during the period under consideration. This would indicate that firms have mostly grown in size by merging with local firms or buying out smaller local operators.},

@techreport{ICES2015a,
abstract = {A. General Stock definition The Icelandic cod stock is distributed all around Iceland, and in the assessment landings of cod within Icelandic EEZ waters it is assumed to be a single homogeneous unit. Spawning takes place in late winter mainly off the southwest coast but smaller, variable regional spawning components have also been observed all around Iceland. The conventional wisdom has been that pelagic eggs and larvae from the main spawning grounds off the southwest coast drift clockwise northwards and eastward along the island to the main nursery grounds off the north coast. The mature stock takes on feeding migration from the spawning grounds to feeding grounds both to deeper waters in the northwest and southeast or within the shallow water realm of the continental shelf proper. A larval drift to Greenland waters has been recorded in some years and substantial immigrations of mature cod from Greenland which are considered to be of Icelandic origin have been observed in some periods. This pattern was considered to be quite prevalent prior to 1970, when condition in Greenlandic waters were favourable for cod productivity. Periodic immigrations have been estimated in the assessment from anomalies in the catch-at-age matrix with timing and age of such events being based on expert judgement using external information. The most recent of such migration was from the 1984 year class in 1990, the number estimated around 30 million. Recent tagging experiments as well as abnormal decline in survey indices in West Greenlandic waters indicate that part of the 2003 and to some extent the 2002 year classes may have migrated from Greenland to Icelandic waters. In the current assessment the immigration at age 6 in 2009 is estimated around 9.7 million corresponding an additional biomass of around 31 kt in 2009. The influence of this immigration on the current biomass estimate is minimal. A slight but significant genetic difference has been observed between the cod spawning in the northern waters vs. cod spawning in the southern waters (Pampoulie et al., 2007). There are indications that different behavioural type (shallow vs. deep migration) may be found within cod spawning in the same areas (Pampoulie et al., 2008). In addition genetic comparisons of cod sample in Greenlandic waters indicate that there is genetic affinity of mature cod in Icelandic and east and southwestern Greenlandic waters.},

abstract = {Many of the world's fish populations are overexploited, and the ecosystems that sustain them are degraded (1). Unintended consequences of fishing, including habitat destruction, incidental mortality of nontarget species, evolutionary shifts in population demographics, and changes in the function and structure of ecosystems, are being increasingly recognized. Fisheries management to date has often been ineffective; it focuses on maximizing the catch of a single target species and often ignores habitat, predators, and prey of the target species and other ecosystem components and interactions. The indirect social and economic costs of the focus on single species can be substantial. For example, over 90{\%} of the annual mortality of white marlin, a species petitioned for listing under the U.S. Endangered Species Act, occurs through incidental catch in swordfish and tuna longline fisheries. This threatens a recreational fishing industry worth up to U.S.{\$}2 billion annually (2). To address the critical need for a more effective and holistic management approach, a variety of advisory panels (3–9) have recommended ecosystem considerations be considered broadly and consistently in managing fisheries. Ecosystem-based fishery management (EBFM) is a new direction for fishery management, essentially reversing the order of management priorities to start with the ecosystem rather than the target species.},

abstract = {Expansion and development of the fisheries sector was the driving force behind Iceland's economic transformation during the 20th century. However, the role of fisheries in national and regional economies is neither well documented nor understood. National accounts do not fully reflect the significant part played by the fisheries as they do not take into consideration the various ways economic activity in the fisheries sector affects other branches of the economy. The fisheries sector, which includes fishing and fish processing, has been established as a base industry within the Icelandic economy. Using data collected during 2010 and 2011 and cluster analysis techniques, this paper seeks to establish the economic importance of the fishing industry in Iceland. As a base industry, this paper finds that a wide range of companies have gradually developed to service the sector and through these interlinkages, the fisheries sector and its related operations can be viewed as an industry cluster. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = "Integrated models are able to combine several sources of data into a single analysis using joint likelihood functions, fostering the consistency of assumptions among analyses and the ability to diagnose goodness of fit and model-misspecification. Owing to their capacity to consistently combine diverse information, integrated models could detect the variability induced by external drivers, such as various environmental drivers, on key components of the stock dynamics (e.g. recruitment) in cases where these external drivers are relevant but not yet identified or incorporated into the modelling exercise. This diagnosing power could then be used to explore causality between fishery dynamics, as estimated by the integrated model, and external drivers. To achieve this aim, a correlation analysis is neither necessary nor sufficient to prove causation. An alternative statistical concept, Granger-causality, provides a framework that uses predictability, rather than correlation, to give more evidence of causation between time-series variables. A two-step procedure to investigate external forcings in stock dynamics is proposed. First, an integrated model is implemented to detect anomalies that cannot be explained by the internal dynamics of the stock. Then, in a second step, Granger-causality is used to detect the external origin of these anomalies. This two-step procedure is explored using the European anchovy in the Gulf of Cádiz as an example population where the external (environmental) drivers are well documented. The fishery dynamics is first estimated through an age-length model (Gadget). Then Granger-causality is used to assess the predictive power of different environmental drivers on recruitment. The results indicate that this is a powerful procedure, although also with important limitations, to determine predictability and that it can be implemented in a wide variety of stocks and external drivers. Moreover, once Granger-causality has been identified, it is shown that it can be used to forecast by making few modifications of the integrated model used for diagnosis."

abstract = "In the mid-2000s, summer feeding distribution of Northeast Atlantic mackerel (Scomber scombrus) in Nordic Seas began expanding into new areas. The present study explores how spawning stock biomass (SSB) and environmental conditions influenced this expansion using data from scientific surveys conducted in Nordic Seas from 1997 to 2016. During that period mackerel distribution range increased three-fold and the centre-of-gravity shifted westward by 1650 km and northward by 400 km. Distribution range peaked in 2014 and was positively correlated to SSB. Mackerel was present in temperatures ranging from 5 °C to 15 °C, but preferred areas with temperatures between 9 °C and 13 °C according to univariate quotient analysis. Generalized additive models showed that both mackerel occurrence and density were positively related to location, ambient temperature, mesozooplankton density and SSB, explaining 47\% and 32\% of deviance, respectively. Mackerel relative mean weight-at-length was positively related to location, day-of-year, temperature and SSB, but not with mesozooplankton density, explaining 40\% of the deviance. We conclude that geographical expansion of mackerel during the summer feeding season in Nordic Seas was driven by increasing mackerel stock size and constrained by availability of preferred temperature and abundance of mesozooplankton. Marine climate with multidecadal variability probably impacted the observed distributional changes but were not evaluated. Our results were limited to the direct effects of temperature, mesozooplankton abundance, and SSB on distribution range during the last two decades and should be viewed as such."

abstract ={The Icelandic cod stock is analysed with respect to the probable effects of different harvesting strategies on yield, spawning stock biomass, and economic benefits. Simulations are used to investigate the probability of stock recovery and collapse. Potential yield and economic benefits/costs are also investigated, using stochastic and deterministic models. In stochastic simulations, attention is paid to the apparent stock–recruitment relationship, the highly variable weight-at-age and maturity-at-age in Icelandic waters along with the inevitable inaccuracies in current and future assessments. Regardless of method, substantial reduction in catches from recent (1993) levels is seen to be necessary in order to rebuild the stock. In the deterministic model, profit maximization mandates closure of the fishery until the stock is rehabilitated. Using the stochastic model, it is predicted that recent catch levels lead to eventual extinction of the stock with high probability. A management procedure is formulated and its application to the model is shown to lead to stabilization of the stock around an economically and biologically acceptable level.},

Ecosystem structure in the Iceland Sea and recent changes to the capelin (Mallotus villosus) population. – ICES Journal of Marine Science, 69: .
The objective of the Iceland Sea Ecosystem Project was to analyse principal ecosystem patterns, including the life history of capelin. Ten surveys were conducted for this purpose between 2006 and 2008, and hydrographic data from 1970 to 2011 were analysed. Long-term temporal patterns indicate an increase in the temperature of surface and intermediate waters during recent years in the Iceland Sea. The phytoplankton consisted mainly of diatoms in spring, with flagellates and dinoflagellates appearing later in the year. Zooplankton and fish were dominated by a few species. In late summer, the pelagic foodweb ranged between trophic levels 2.4 and 3.6. Trends in nutrients and primary production showed a clear seasonal pattern with a spring bloom in late May, followed by a peak in secondary production in July/August. The spatial structure of the lower ecosystem levels in summer was stable across the 3 years, determined mainly by the structure of the water masses. The pelagic fish fauna consisted primarily of adult pelagic fish and transient numbers of larval species. The spatial pattern of capelin indicated northward displacement of 0-group capelin and westward displacement of older capelin in recent years. The annual biomass was estimated at 3.8 million tonnes of phytoplankton, ∼21 million tonnes of zooplankton, and 1.0 million tonnes of fish.},

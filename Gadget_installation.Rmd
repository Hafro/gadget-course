Gadget is housed on the MFRI github site https://github.com/Hafro/gadget. Basic
installation instructions can be found there, below they are given step-by-step. Notice
that the extremely useful resource 'Gadget User Guide' is included with the installation.

# Prerequisites

To compile Gadget one needs a working C++ compiler and a version of Make installed on the
computer.

## Linux

The compiler and Make should be installed automatically on most linux distributions but on ubuntu one needs to install build-essentials:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Mac

It should be sufficient to install XCode through the Appstore and through XCode's preferences install commandline tools.

## Windows

The easiest way is to install uses
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) . During the install process 
allow the installer to append to the system path.

# Download, compile and install

## Standard procedure

To install Gadget you can simply click the "download as a zip file" button. Unzip this file and within command prompt/terminal application make your way to the resulting folder, typically called gadget-master, and simply type:
```
make
```
Recommended: for convenience you may want to install the resulting gadget executable to a location in the system path, thus allowing the gadget executable to called in any directory. On *nix based system you can simply type:
```
sudo make install
```
Be aware of where your gadget executable is located (for example by searching for
'gadget' on your computer). Whenever Gadget is run via Rgadget, this executable will be
called, so Gadget's path should be listed within R as a search path. This should be
automatic if installed using 'sudo'.

## Recommended: via Git

We recommend installing via Git because it provides for easy updating and if you don't
already use git, then this is a good time to start: can be extremely useful later for
version control and sharing of your Gadget models while under development. This subject
will be touched upon on the last day of the course. To download and/or install Git, follow the instructions found
[here](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/). 
Note that Git comes prepackaged with Linux systems so it only needs to be installed via 
the instructions on that website.

Next, Gadget can be cloned (rather than downloaded) from the github website using Git. 
From terminal, use: [IS AN ACCOUNT NECESSARY FOR THIS?]

```
git clone git@github.com:Hafro/gadget.git
```
Navigate to the gadget directory, then install:
```
cd <gadget path>
cd gadget
make -j 8 [is this necessary?]
sudo make install
```
To check that gadget is installed, you can try opening the manual:
```
man gadget
```
To update, navigate to the gadget directory then use:
```
git pull
make
```
If using git pull shows gadget as already up-to-date but Rgadget gives an error that
Gadget needs updating, then just delete the gadget directory and re-install.

Gadget is housed on the MFRI github site https://github.com/Hafro/gadget. Basic
installation instructions can be found there, below they are given step-by-step. Notice
that the extremely useful resource 'Gadget User Guide' is included with the installation.

# Prerequisites

To compile Gadget one needs a working C++ compiler and a version of Make installed on the
computer.

## Linux

The compiler and Make should be installed automatically on most linux distributions but on ubuntu one needs to install build-essentials:
```
sudo apt-get install build-essential
```

## Mac

It should be sufficient to install XCode through the Appstore and through XCode's preferences install commandline tools.

## Windows

The easiest way is to install uses
[Rtools](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/) . During the install process 
allow the installer to append to the system path.

# Download, compile and install

## Standard procedure

To install Gadget you can simply click the "download as a zip file" button. Unzip this file and within command prompt/terminal application make your way to the resulting folder, typically called gadget-master, and simply type:
```
make
```
Recommended: for convenience you may want to install the resulting gadget executable to a location in the system path, thus allowing the gadget executable to called in any directory. On *nix based system you can simply type:
```
sudo make install
```
Be aware of where your gadget executable is located (for example by searching for
'gadget' on your computer). Whenever Gadget is run via Rgadget, this executable will be
called, so Gadget's path should be listed within R as a search path. This should be
take care of when installed using `sudo make install`.

If it is not possible to install gadget for all users of the computer, due to lack of privileges (such as administrator rights) on the computer, one can move the gadget binary to a position on the search path. E.g. if you want to store the gadget binary a directory name `bin` on your home directory you can:

```
## if the bin directory does not exist create it
mkdir ~/bin 
## move the gadget binary to ~/bin
mv gadget ~/bin

## update the path (if needed)
echo PATH=$HOME/bin:$PATH >> ~/.bash_profile
echo export PATH >> ~/.bash_profile
```

and then Rgadget should be able to find gadget. 

## Recommended: via Git

We recommend installing via Git because it provides for easy updating and if you don't
already use git, then this is a good time to start: can be extremely useful later for
version control and sharing of your Gadget models while under development. This subject
will be touched upon on the last day of the course. To download and/or install Git, follow the instructions found
[here](https://www.linode.com/docs/development/version-control/how-to-install-git-on-linux-mac-and-windows/). 
Note that Git comes prepackaged with Linux systems so it only needs to be installed via 
the instructions on that website.

Next, Gadget can be cloned (rather than downloaded) from the github website using Git. 
From terminal, use: 

```
git clone git@github.com:Hafro/gadget.git
```
Navigate to the gadget directory, then install:
```
cd <gadget path>
cd gadget
make 
sudo make install
```
To check that gadget is installed, you can try opening the manual:
```
man gadget
```
To update, navigate to the gadget directory then use:
```
git pull
make
sudo make install
```
